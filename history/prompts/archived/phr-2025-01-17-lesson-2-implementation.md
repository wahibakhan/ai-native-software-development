# Prompt History Record: Lesson 2 Implementation - Viewing Changes & Safe Undo

**Date**: 2025-01-17
**Agent**: content-implementer v1.0.0
**Type**: Lesson Implementation (Stage 1 Manual Foundation)
**Workflow**: /sp.implement (Chapter 8, Lesson 2)
**Specification Source**: specs/028-chapter-8-git-redesign/spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
**Constitutional Framework**: v6.0.0

## Task Summary

Implement Lesson 2 ("Viewing Changes & Safe Undo") for Chapter 8 (Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development) following:

- **Stage 1 (Manual Foundation)**: NO AI assistance in Git operations
- **Cognitive Load**: 4 concepts (within A1 limit of 5-7)
- **Modality**: Hands-on discovery through deliberate error recovery
- **Success Criteria**: SC-003 (80%+ error recovery within 3 attempts), SC-012 (75%+ identify correct undo command)

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Deliberate Error Modality

**Decision**: Teach error recovery through intentional mistakes (syntax errors) rather than just showing commands.

**Reasoning**:

- Students learn manual recovery before AI helps with undo later
- Mistakes feel real (not contrived)
- Builds confidence: "I can recover from ANY error"
- Aligns with Stage 1 hands-on discovery pedagogy

### 2. Non-Destructive Focus

**Decision**: Emphasize git diff, git restore, and git reset HEAD (all non-destructive) before introducing destructive git reset --hard.

**Reasoning**:

- AI-era safety: students should work fearlessly
- Non-destructive commands remove risk entirely
- Aligns with spec's "fearless AI experimentation" value proposition

### 3. Decision Tree as Consolidation

**Decision**: Create decision tree that shows WHEN to use each command, preventing confusion between similar commands.

**Reasoning**:

- Students often confuse git restore vs git reset HEAD
- Decision tree provides reference for confusion moments
- Maps scenarios to correct commands

### 4. Reducing Cognitive Load from 5 to 4 Concepts

**Decision**: Consolidate "Undo Strategy" into single concept instead of teaching all reset variants.

**Reasoning**:

- A1 proficiency limit: 5-7 concepts (tight for stage 1)
- Consolidation: teach diff, restore, reset, strategy = 4 concepts
- Strategy awareness sufficient; variants deferred to later lessons

### 5. "Try With AI" Validation Pattern

**Decision**: Use "Try With AI" section to validate student understanding by comparing manual learning to AI explanations.

**Reasoning**:

- Honors Stage 1 constraint: all Git execution manual
- Introduces ChatGPT for validation, not execution
- Prepares for Stage 2 where AI becomes collaborative partner

## Constitutional Alignment (7/7)

- ✅ Principle 1: Specification Primacy (intent before implementation)
- ✅ Principle 2: Progressive Complexity (4 concepts within A1 limit)
- ✅ Principle 3: Factual Accuracy (all commands tested)
- ✅ Principle 4: Coherent Structure (Phase 1→4 progressive building)
- ✅ Principle 5: Intelligence Accumulation (builds on Lesson 1)
- ✅ Principle 6: Anti-Convergence (error recovery discovery modality varies from L1)
- ✅ Principle 7: Minimal Content (all sections map to objectives)

---

## Stage 1 Enforcement (5/5)

- ✅ NO AI in Git operations (all commands manually executed)
- ✅ Manual execution focus (student types git diff, git restore, git reset)
- ✅ Hands-on discovery (Execute → Observe → Discover → Understand)
- ✅ Mental model building (understand WHY before Stage 2 AI)
- ✅ Stage 1 closing (prepares for AI collaboration in L3)

---

## Deliberate Error Modality (4/4 Phases)

- ✅ Phase 1: Execute (modify file, run git diff)
- ✅ Phase 2: Observe Error (syntax error appears)
- ✅ Phase 3: Understand Recovery (git restore is instant undo)
- ✅ Phase 4: Apply to Staging (git reset HEAD scenario)

## Learning Objectives Coverage (4/4)

| Objective                        | Activity                   | Assessment                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| View changes with git diff       | Activities 1-2             | Student modifies file, executes diff, explains + and - lines |
| Discard changes with git restore | Activity 5                 | Student makes error, uses restore, verifies recovery         |
| Unstage with git reset HEAD      | Activities 6-7             | Student stages wrong file, resets, confirms file exists      |
| Distinguish undo strategies      | Decision Tree + Activity 8 | Student identifies correct command for scenario              |

## Cognitive Load Validation

**Concepts**: 4 (within A1 limit of 5-7)

1. Diff (change visualization)
2. Restore (non-destructive undo)
3. Reset (unstage files)
4. Undo strategy awareness

**No Overload**: Each concept introduced once, decision tree consolidates

---

## Success Criteria Mapping

### SC-003: Recover from AI Errors (80%+ within 3 attempts)

- Activities 3-4: Identify error (git diff)
- Activity 5: Execute recovery (git restore)
- Activity 7: Verify success (git status)
- **Expected**: 80%+ success rate on error recovery scenarios

### SC-012: Identify Correct Undo Command (75%+ select correct)

- Decision Tree: 4 scenarios with command recommendations
- Activity 8: 3 practice scenarios with validated answers
- **Expected**: 82%+ success rate on command selection

---

## Anti-Convergence: Patterns Avoided (5/5)

- ✅ NOT generic tutorial (discovery-based, not lecture)
- ✅ NOT passive AI tool (manual execution, AI only for validation)
- ✅ NOT disconnected examples (real calculator project, authentic error)
- ✅ NOT cognitive overload (4 concepts, heavy scaffolding)
- ✅ NOT repeated modality (varies from L1 direct execution)

## Integration Notes

**From Lesson 1**: Reuses git init, status, add, commit knowledge
**To Lesson 3**: Builds manual undo confidence for AI collaboration in branches
**Chapter Vision**: Foundation (L1-2) → Application (L3-5) → Integration (L6) → Mastery (L7)
