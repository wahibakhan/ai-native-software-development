## Constitutional Compliance Assessment

**7 Core Principles** (from constitution v6.0.0):

1. ✅ **Specification Primacy** (INTENT before IMPLEMENTATION)

   - All "Why This Matters" sections show methodology before features
   - L4 (Lesson 9) positioned as spec-driven composition capstone

2. ⚠️ **Progressive Complexity** (Cognitive load appropriate for tier)

   - 8/9 lessons compliant with A2/B1 tier limits
   - **Issue**: Lesson 2 (A2 tier, 8 concepts) exceeds ≤7 limit
   - **Recommendation**: Re-stage as B1 or reduce to 7 concepts

3. 🔲 **Factual Accuracy** (Verifiable and cited)

   - **Pending**: Sandbox testing (T057-T064)
   - **Pending**: Citation verification (T067)

4. ✅ **Coherent Structure** (Progressive understanding)

   - L1→L2→L3→L4 progression explicit in README
   - Prerequisite chains validated (non-circular)

5. ✅ **Intelligence Accumulation** (Context from previous lessons)

   - L9 capstone integrates all L1-L8 concepts
   - "Why This Matters" sections explicitly reference prior lessons

6. ✅ **Anti-Convergence** (Varying teaching modality)

   - Surgical targeting: L6 (-39%), L9 (-60%), others minimal or expanded
   - Not uniform "reduce all lessons by 20%"

7. 🔲 **Minimal Content** (Every section maps to learning objective)
   - **Pending**: Theory-to-practice ratio verification (T073)
   - **Concern**: L6 spot check showed 34% practice (target ≥60%)

**Overall Compliance**: 4/7 verified ✅, 1/7 minor issue ⚠️, 2/7 pending manual testing 🔲

---

## Issues Identified & Recommendations

### Issue 1: Lesson 2 Concept Count Exceeds Tier Limit ⚠️

**Severity**: LOW
**Impact**: Constitutional compliance (Progressive Complexity principle)
**Current**: 8 concepts (A2 tier limit is ≤7)

**Options**:

1. **Re-stage Lesson 2 as B1** (recommended) - Installation involves multiple tools/methods, appropriate for intermediate
2. Reduce concept count to 7 (combine related concepts)
3. Accept as-is with justification (installation inherently complex)

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Change `stage: "L1"` to `stage: "B1"` in lesson 2 metadata

### Issue 2: Theory-to-Practice Ratio Concern 🔲

**Severity**: LOW-MEDIUM
**Impact**: Show-Through-Doing principle compliance
**Current**: L6 spot check shows 34% practice (target ≥60%)
**Context**: Post-reduction, removed some redundant practice examples

**Recommendation**: Full manual count across all lessons required (T073) to determine if isolated or chapter-wide

### Issue 3: Sandbox Testing Required 🔲

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Factual Accuracy principle (cannot verify without testing)
**Current**: 8 code examples untested (installation, MCP, plugins, etc.)

**Recommendation**: User or QA team execute T057-T064 in clean Claude Code environment

---

## Reasoning Activation Evidence

**Persona Application**:

- Content implementer executing surgical refinements (not generic "make it better")
- Applied lesson-specific strategies from plan.md (not one-size-fits-all)

**Decision Frameworks**:

- **Phase-based organization**: Grouped similar tasks (all metadata, then content, then reductions)
- **Risk-managed sequencing**: LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH (built confidence before critical work)
- **Surgical targeting**: L6 and L9 had specific 8-step reduction strategies (not generic compression)

**Meta-Awareness**:

- Avoided uniform reduction (not "cut 20% from every lesson")
- Expanded lessons where methodology needed (L4 +56, L5 +34 lines)
- Preserved reference-quality content (L3 Three Roles demonstration untouched)

**Pattern Recognition**:

- LoopFlow v2.0 orchestration enabled phase-by-phase execution with validation gates
- Reasoning-activated prompting (Persona + Questions + Principles) applied at each phase
- Constitutional frameworks (4-Layer Method, Three Roles) guided all content decisions

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate** (before publication):

1. **Address Issue 1**: Re-stage Lesson 2 as B1 (or reduce concepts to 7)
2. **User/QA Execution**: Run sandbox tests T057-T064
3. **User/QA Execution**: Verify CLI commands and citations T066-T067
4. **User/QA Execution**: Complete theory-to-practice ratio count T073
5. **After Testing**: Create SANDBOX-AUDIT-REPORT.md T065

**Post-Validation** (if tests pass): 6. Git commit all changes with descriptive message 7. Create pull request for review 8. Deploy to Docusaurus preview environment 9. Final QA review before merge to main

**If Tests Fail**:

- Document failures in SANDBOX-AUDIT-REPORT.md
- Fix code examples/commands
- Re-test
- Update lessons as needed
