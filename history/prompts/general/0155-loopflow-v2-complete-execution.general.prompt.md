## Prompt

User invoked `/sp.loopflow.v2` to rewrite Chapter 9 (Markdown - The Language of AI Communication) with critical constraint: **NO programming code examples** (students haven't learned any programming language yet).

**Initial Request**:
"Rewrite Chapter 9 with specification-first approach. Students in Part 3 haven't learned Python yet, so current Lesson 4 (which has Python/Bash examples) violates pedagogical sequencing. Transform markdown from formatting tool tutorial to specification language curriculum."

**Critical Constraints**:

- ZERO code examples (Python, Bash, JavaScript forbidden)
- A2 tier cognitive load (5-7 concepts per section)
- Specification-first modality (varies from Chapter 8 hands-on discovery)
- 4-stage progression (Manual → AI Collaboration → Intelligence Design → Spec-Driven Integration)
- Three Roles demonstrated in Lessons 2-3 (through narrative, not labels)
- Lesson ending protocol: ONLY "Try With AI" section
- CommonMark compliance

**LoopFlow v2.0 Workflow Executed**:

**Phase 0: Constitutional Reasoning Engine**

- Read constitution.md (v6.0.0), chapter-index.md, existing lessons
- Applied constitutional frameworks: Section IIa (4-Stage Teaching), Principle 2 (Progressive Complexity), Principle 6 (Anti-Convergence)
- Asked 2 clarification questions: capstone scope, Mermaid diagrams
- User selected: "Simple task management system", "No Mermaid"

**Phase 1: Specification (/sp.specify)**

- Generated reasoning-activated prompt using Persona + Questions + Principles
- Created spec.md (582 lines) with 5 user stories, 30 functional requirements, 21 acceptance tests
- User approved: "proceed"

**Phase 2: Planning (/sp.plan)**

- Generated reasoning-activated prompt
- Created plan.md (1,181 lines) with 5 lessons, concept density analysis (33 concepts ÷ 5 = 6.6 avg)
- Pedagogical arc: Foundation → Application (Lists) → Application (Code Blocks) → Integration → Mastery
- User approved: "proceed"

**Phase 3: Tasks (/sp.tasks)**

- Generated reasoning-activated prompt
- Created tasks.md (84 tasks across 9 phases)
- Organized by lesson (lesson = user story equivalent)
- Embedded 21 acceptance tests as validation tasks
- User approved: "continue"

**Phase 4: Implementation (content-implementer)**

- Generated reasoning-activated prompt with Persona + Questions + Principles
- Invoked content-implementer agent
- Created all 5 lessons with constitutional compliance
- Updated chapter README
- Created validation report

**Phase 5: Finalization** (current)

- Creating meta-learning PHR
- Documenting workflow patterns for future use

## Response snapshot

**Complete 5-Phase Execution**:

**Phase 0 Output**: Constitutional reasoning derived 5-lesson structure, specification-first modality, no-code constraint enforcement strategy

**Phase 1 Output**: spec.md with evals (11 success criteria), intent (WHAT/WHY/WHO), 5 user stories (P1 priorities), 30 functional requirements, constraints (forbidden/required), 21 acceptance tests

**Phase 2 Output**: plan.md with lesson breakdown, concept density justification (6.6 avg within A2 limits), pedagogical arc mapping, stage-by-stage teaching approach, Three Roles integration patterns

**Phase 3 Output**: tasks.md with 84 tasks organized into Setup → Foundational → 5 Lessons → Validation → Polish, grep validation commands, constitutional compliance checklists

**Phase 4 Output**:

- 5 complete lessons (275 min total, 6.6 concepts/lesson avg)
- Lesson 1: Manual Foundation (markdown as specification language)
- Lesson 2: Lists + AI Collaboration begins (Three Roles: Teacher)
- Lesson 3: Code blocks for specs (Three Roles: Student + Co-Worker)
- Lesson 4: Templates (Intelligence Design with Persona + Questions + Principles)
- Lesson 5: Capstone (task management system specification)
- Updated README with specification-first pedagogy overview
- Validation report confirming constitutional compliance

**Phase 5 Output**: Meta-learning documentation (this PHR)

**Validation Results**:

- ✅ Zero code examples (grep validation passed)
- ✅ All lessons end with "Try With AI" ONLY
- ✅ No internal labels in student-facing text
- ✅ Concept counts: L1=6, L2=7, L3=7, L4=5, L5=8 (avg 6.6, within A2)
- ✅ Three Roles demonstrated through narrative (Lessons 2-3)
- ✅ Persona + Questions + Principles template (Lesson 4)
- ✅ Capstone composes all skills (Lesson 5)
- ✅ CommonMark compliance validated
- ✅ SDD-RI positioning (markdown as Intent Layer)

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Complete chapter redesign from generic markdown tutorial to specification-first curriculum. 5 lessons implementing 4-stage progression with constitutional compliance. Students learn markdown as specification language BEFORE learning programming (Part 4).

- 🧪 **Tests**: N/A (Educational content validated through 21 acceptance tests mapped to validation tasks, not automated tests)

- 📁 **Files**:

  - Created: 3 design documents (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
  - Created: 5 new lesson files (01-05.md)
  - Updated: 1 chapter README
  - Created: 2 validation artifacts (checklist, report)
  - Created: 2 PHRs (tasks generation, complete workflow)
  - **Total**: 13 files created/updated

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:

  - Optional: Run validation-auditor for comprehensive quality check
  - Optional: Peer review with another educator
  - Git workflow: Commit changes, create PR, merge to main
  - Publication: Deploy to Docusaurus for student access

- 🧠 **Reflection**: LoopFlow v2.0 successfully executed end-to-end with reasoning activation at each phase. Key insights:

  **What Worked**:

  1. **Constitutional Reasoning Engine**: Deriving workflow from constitutional principles (not templates) ensured decisions were context-appropriate
  2. **Persona + Questions + Principles**: Activated reasoning mode in all agents (spec-architect, chapter-planner, content-implementer)
  3. **User Story Mapping**: Educational content maps cleanly to user stories (lessons = atomic deliverable units)
  4. **Validation Integration**: Embedding acceptance tests as validation tasks ensured constitutional compliance throughout
  5. **Sequential Approval Gates**: User approvals after each phase prevented compounding errors

  **Patterns Discovered**:

  1. **Lesson = User Story Equivalence**: In educational content, lessons function like user stories (independent, implementable, validatable)
  2. **Concept Density as Cognitive Load Metric**: Counting concepts per section provides objective A2 tier validation
  3. **Grep as Constitutional Validator**: Simple grep patterns effectively enforce no-code constraint
  4. **Narrative > Labels**: Three Roles embedded through storytelling (not section headers) increases pedagogical effectiveness
  5. **Template Intelligence**: Persona + Questions + Principles pattern creates truly reusable intelligence (not just structure)

  **Intelligence Accumulated**:

  - Feature Specification Template (Lesson 4) - reusable across projects
  - No-code validation patterns (grep commands) - reusable for other pre-programming chapters
  - Specification-first modality - reusable for future chapters before Part 4
  - Educational task structure - template for future chapter redesigns

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**:

  1. Initial feature number format error (009 vs 034) - minor, self-corrected
  2. File write before read error - minor, self-corrected
  3. No major failures in reasoning-activated workflow

- **Graders run and results**:

  - Constitutional compliance: PASS (all 21 acceptance tests validated)
  - No-code constraint: PASS (zero programming examples)
  - A2 cognitive load: PASS (concept density 6.6 avg)
  - 4-stage progression: PASS (explicit mapping)
  - Three Roles: PASS (narrative demonstration)

- **Prompt variant**: LoopFlow v2.0 with Persona + Questions + Principles pattern (reasoning-activated edition)

- **Next experiment**:
  1. Test LoopFlow v2.0 on software development feature (not educational content) to validate generalizability
  2. Measure time savings: reasoning-activated vs template-based approaches
  3. A/B test: Students using specification-first curriculum vs traditional markdown tutorials
  4. Validate template reusability: Use Feature Specification Template in other contexts
  5. Meta-pattern extraction: Can reasoning activation pattern generalize beyond SDD-RI?

**Key Takeaway**: Reasoning activation through Persona + Questions + Principles transforms agents from template-fillers to context-aware decision-makers. This workflow demonstrates SDD-RI at meta-level: specification (constitutional frameworks) drives development (lesson implementation) with reusable intelligence (templates, validation patterns).
