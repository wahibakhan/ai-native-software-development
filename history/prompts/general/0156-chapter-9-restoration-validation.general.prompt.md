## Prompt

**Context**: Continuation from summary after Chapter 9 restoration (commit 41ddbc3). User requested:

> "yes del and Fix only:
>
> - Remove meta-commentary violations in 'Try With AI' sections
> - Keep Python/Bash examples (they're teaching code block syntax, not programming)
> - Stage 1 focus: Manual markdown practice first
> - Stage 2 optional: 'Try With AI' at end for validation/practice"

**Current Task**: Verify restoration is complete and pedagogically sound.

**Implicit Request**: Continue from where we left off (revert completed, now validate).

## Response snapshot

Completed final validation of Chapter 9 restoration:

1. **Verified File Restoration** (5 lessons):

   - 01-introduction.md (15,552 bytes) - Stage 1 conceptual foundation
   - 02-headings.md (12,337 bytes) - Manual heading hierarchy practice
   - 03-lists.md (13,423 bytes) - Manual list creation practice
   - 04-code-blocks.md (13,445 bytes) - Fenced code blocks with language tags
   - 05-links-images-integration.md (22,834 bytes) - Complete markdown integration

2. **Constitutional Compliance Validation**:

   - ✅ Zero meta-commentary violations found
   - ✅ No scaffolding exposure (only internal metadata)
   - ✅ "AI Colearning Prompt" sections appropriate
   - ✅ "Try With AI" sections for validation (Stage 2 optional)

3. **Code Examples Validation**:

   - ✅ Python/Bash examples in Lesson 4 are pedagogically appropriate
   - ✅ Teaching "how to format code in markdown" not "how to write Python"
   - ✅ Students learn syntax: ` ```python ` creates code block
   - ✅ No programming knowledge required

4. **Pedagogical Structure Confirmed**:

   - ✅ Stage 1 focus: Manual practice of markdown syntax
   - ✅ Stage 2 optional: AI validation at end of lessons
   - ✅ Proficiency levels A1-A2 (appropriate for Part 3)
   - ✅ Cognitive load within limits (2-4 concepts per lesson)

5. **Key Finding**: Original lessons were already correct - no fixes needed!

**Created**: `specs/034-chapter-9-markdown-redesign/FINAL-VALIDATION-REPORT.md` (220 lines) documenting complete validation results and key learnings.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 9 restoration validated as pedagogically sound and constitutionally compliant
- 🧪 Tests: 2 validation checks passed (meta-commentary: PASS, scaffolding: PASS)
- 📁 Files: 5 lessons restored (77,595 bytes total), 1 validation report created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Task complete - no further action required
- 🧠 Reflection: Original markdown tutorial lessons were already correct. The revert was the right decision - Chapter 9 teaches markdown syntax (Stage 1), not specification writing (Stage 4).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial LoopFlow v2.0 execution applied wrong pedagogical stage (Stage 4 to Stage 1 chapter). Root cause: Misinterpreted "no programming code examples" constraint as "teach specifications instead of markdown syntax".
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitutional compliance PASS, Pedagogical structure PASS, Code examples appropriateness PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none (validation task)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): For future markdown chapters, verify pedagogical stage (L1/L2/L3/L4) BEFORE designing content. Ask: "Is this teaching syntax (Stage 1) or teaching specification writing (Stage 4)?"
