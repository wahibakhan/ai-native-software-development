## Prompt

/sp.implement - Execute full implementation of Chapter 14 rewrite from video generation to Spec-Kit Plus workflow focus.

Context: Chapter 14 previously taught video generation with MCP/Playwright. User requested pivot to teach Spec-Kit Plus workflow using research paper as simple practice vehicle. Each lesson must teach ONE Spec-Kit Plus command, not research paper writing.

User Stories:

- US1 (P1): Master Spec-Kit Plus Workflow (lessons 01-08)
- US2 (P1): Create Reusable Intelligence (lessons 09-10)
- US3 (P2): Experience Intelligence Acceleration (lesson 11)

## Response snapshot

**Implementation completed across 35 tasks:**

### Phase 1: Setup

- Created backup directory at `specs/037-chapter-14-research-paper-pivot/backup/`
- Backed up all 25 original files for rollback capability

### Phase 2-6: Lesson Rewrites (12 files)

- README.md: Updated focus to Spec-Kit Plus, removed video/MCP prerequisites
- Lessons 01-08: Each teaches ONE command (`/sp.constitution`, `/sp.specify`, `/sp.clarify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement`)
- Lesson 09: P+Q+P framework for creating reusable skills
- Lesson 10: Brownfield adoption strategies
- Lesson 11: Capstone demonstrating intelligence acceleration (renamed from youtube-capstone)
- Quiz: Updated to test Spec-Kit Plus knowledge

### Phase 7: Summary Generation (11 files)

- Generated new .summary.md for each lesson using content-implementer subagents
- Summaries capture mental models, key patterns, common mistakes, progression context

### Validation Results

- Forbidden terms: PASS (only README has acceptable "No video APIs" reference)
- Try With AI sections: PASS (11 lessons)
- Backup: PASS (25 files preserved)

## Outcome

- Impact: Chapter 14 now teaches Spec-Kit Plus workflow mastery, not video generation
- Tests: All validation checks PASS
- Files: 12 lessons + 11 summaries rewritten, 25 files backed up
- Key insight: Research paper is practice vehicle, commands are the lesson
- Deleted: 11-youtube-capstone.md and 11-youtube-capstone.summary.md (replaced with 11-capstone.md)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
  - One subagent (Lesson 02) asked for confirmation but didn't write file - required manual intervention
  - Initial summaries still had old video references - regenerated all summaries
- Graders run and results: Grep validation PASS, Try With AI check PASS
- Prompt variant: Used parallel content-implementer subagents for lesson rewrites
- Next experiment: N/A - implementation complete
- Lessons learned:
  1. Verify subagent file writes after completion
  2. Regenerate summaries AFTER lesson rewrites, not in parallel with old content
  3. "No video" in README explaining WHY we don't use video is acceptable
