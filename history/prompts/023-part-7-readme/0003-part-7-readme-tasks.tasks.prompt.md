## Prompt

```text
/sp.tasks 023-part-7-readme
```

**Context**: Task generation for Part 7 README documentation following approved spec and plan.

## Response snapshot

**Tasks File Created**: `specs/023-part-7-readme/tasks.md`

**Key Adaptations**:

1. **Documentation-Specific Task Organization**: Standard tasks template assumes code implementation with user stories. Adapted for documentation workflow:

   - **Phase 1**: Setup (directory creation, reference access)
   - **Phase 2**: Content Drafting (6 sections based on plan.md)
   - **Phase 3**: Refinement (tone, length, anti-convergence)
   - **Phase 4**: Validation (FR/SC compliance)
   - **Phase 5**: Polish (formatting, constitutional compliance)

2. **Section-Based Structure** (18 tasks total):

   - T001-T003: Setup (3 tasks)
   - T004-T009: Content Drafting (6 tasks, one per README section)
   - T010-T012: Refinement (3 tasks)
   - T013-T015: Validation (3 tasks)
   - T016-T018: Polish (3 tasks)

3. **Parallel Execution Opportunities**:

   - Phase 2 sections T004, T005, T008, T009 can be drafted in parallel [P]
   - Enables 4 simultaneous writers for Overview, Goals, Capstone, Getting Started
   - Sequential sections: Chapter Progression (needs chapter-index.md), Methodology Note

4. **Validation Integration**:

   - T013: Validate all 8 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-008)
   - T014: Validate all 6 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006)
   - T015: Self-check against plan.md validation criteria
   - Each validation task includes inline checklist for traceability

5. **Detailed Implementation Guidance**:
   - T007 (Extended Methodology Note): Full 7-layer framework table copied from spec.md FR-003 Expanded
   - Each task includes validation criteria (e.g., "Table has 3 columns", "All 12 chapters mentioned")
   - File paths specified: `apps/learn-app/docs/07-AI-Cloud-Native-Development/README.md`

**Estimated Time**:

- Sequential (single writer): 2-2.5 hours
- Parallel (4 writers): ~90 minutes elapsed

**No Tests**: Documentation task, no test suite required

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation checklist with 18 concrete tasks organized across 5 phases. Tasks are documentation-appropriate (section drafting, validation, formatting) rather than code-focused. Parallel execution strategy enables team collaboration on README content.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required (documentation artifact)
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/023-part-7-readme/tasks.md` (18-task implementation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement 023-part-7-readme` (execute tasks to create README)
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation for documentation requires different approach than code features. Instead of "user stories → models → services → endpoints" pattern, documentation uses "setup → sections → refinement → validation → polish" pattern. Key insight: broke content drafting (Phase 2) into 6 parallel tasks (one per README section) to enable collaborative writing while maintaining structural coherence through plan.md section specifications. Validation tasks (Phase 4) directly check all 8 FRs and 6 SCs for traceability.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Documentation workflow adaptation was appropriate.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all tasks follow checkbox + ID + description + file path format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with documentation-specific adaptation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement to test if task checklist provides sufficient guidance for README creation
