## Prompt

Continue from prior session - execute QA validation phase for Chapter 33 (TASK-016 through TASK-021).

## Response snapshot

**QA Validation Results**:

| Task     | Check                 | Result                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| TASK-016 | Paper alignment       | ✅ PASS - All 7 frameworks present, 0 old frameworks found |
| TASK-017 | Anti-convergence      | ✅ PASS - No meta-commentary violations                    |
| TASK-018 | Citation verification | ✅ PASS - All 5 statistics properly cited                  |
| TASK-019 | CEFR cognitive load   | ✅ PASS - All lessons B1, concepts 0-9 per lesson          |
| TASK-020 | Docusaurus build      | ✅ PASS - Build succeeded                                  |
| TASK-021 | Final readability     | ✅ PASS - Structure verified                               |

**Paper Framework Counts** (must have >0):

- 5-Level Taxonomy: 49 occurrences ✅
- 3+1 Architecture: 31 occurrences ✅
- 5-Step Loop: 45 occurrences ✅
- Multi-Agent Patterns: 56 occurrences ✅
- A2A/Agent Cards: 26 occurrences ✅
- Agent Ops (LM-as-Judge, Traces): 38 occurrences ✅
- Director/Bricklayer: 11 occurrences ✅

**Old Framework Counts** (must be 0):

- "Agency Spectrum": 0 ✅
- "5 Components" (as framework): 0 ✅ (1 mention was "3+1 Architecture components")
- "ReAct pattern" / "Plan-Execute pattern": 0 ✅

**Minor Fix Applied**:

- README.md line 111: Changed "five components" → "3+1 Architecture components" for consistency

**Observation**:

- Lessons 02, 04, 06, 07, 08 lack explicit "## Summary" sections (minor structural inconsistency, content concludes appropriately)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: QA validation complete, Chapter 33 ready for merge
- 🧪 Tests: All 6 QA tasks passed
- 📁 Files: tasks.md status updated to "QA VALIDATION COMPLETE"
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create PR for branch merge to main
- 🧠 Reflection: QA validation confirms paper alignment is strong. The grep patterns for old frameworks found zero matches (excluding false positives), and new frameworks are well-distributed across all lessons.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during QA
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All 6 tasks PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding explicit Summary sections to lessons 02, 04, 06, 07, 08 for structural consistency (optional enhancement)
