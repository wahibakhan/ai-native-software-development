## Prompt

Use MCP server context7 for updated information and also use additional @context\16_chapter8\_\_ides\antigravity.md antigravity.md file for more context to ground antigravity ide lessons.

## Response snapshot

**Partial Implementation Complete** - Phase 1 (Setup) and Lesson 1 (AI-Native Concepts) delivered with critical structure correction.

**Key Achievements**:

1. **Structure Correction** (Critical Discovery):

   - **Initial Error**: Created nested `lessons/01-ai-native-concepts/` subdirectory structure
   - **User Correction**: Pointed out book uses flat structure (numbered files directly in chapter directory)
   - **Fixed Structure**: Adopted correct pattern from Chapter 5 (05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/)
   - **Correct Pattern**: `01-lesson-name.md`, `02-lesson-name.md`, etc. directly in chapter directory
   - **Decision Source**: Examined existing Chapter 5 structure, confirmed flat file pattern

2. **Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure** (Tasks T001-T006):

   - ✅ Chapter directory created
   - ✅ Subdirectories: assets/, exercises/, templates/ (removed incorrect lessons/)
   - ✅ Chapter README.md with 8-lesson overview
   - ✅ Observational comparison template
   - ✅ Reflection prompt template (1500-2000 word guide)
   - ✅ Assets subdirectories: screenshots/, diagrams/, videos/, code-samples/, research/

3. **Lesson 1: AI-Native Concepts** (Tasks T021-T026):

   - ✅ Complete content (1,548 lines) in single file: `01-ai-native-concepts.md`
   - ✅ Sections included:
     - What Makes an IDE AI-Native? (architectural design vs plugins)
     - Three Key Characteristics (context-aware AI, multi-model support, agent capabilities)
     - AI-Native vs Plugin Architecture (comparison table)
     - Why Architecture Matters (speed, context quality, evolution)
     - The Landscape in 2025 (Zed, Cursor, Antigravity overview)
     - Practice reflection questions

4. **Constitutional Compliance Validation**:

   - ✅ NO meta-commentary ("What to notice", "AI teaches you")
   - ✅ NO Three Roles labels (Layer 1 conceptual, before collaboration)
   - ✅ proficiency_level: A2
   - ✅ Ends with "Practice" section (not meta-commentary)
   - ✅ Cognitive load: 5-7 concepts per section (A2 appropriate)
   - ✅ Observational learning approach emphasized

5. **Parallel Subagent Strategy** (Lessons 2-8):

   - Launched 8 content-implementer subagents for parallel lesson creation
   - Subagents provided summaries, not deliverable file content
   - Realized scope too large for single session (191 tasks, 80+ files)
   - Pivoted to sequential lesson-by-lesson approach

6. **Implementation Status Tracking**:
   - Created IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md with comprehensive progress tracking
   - Overall progress: 17/191 tasks (9% complete)
   - Phase 1: 6/6 tasks (100%)
   - Lesson 1: 10/10 tasks (100%)
   - Remaining: Lessons 2-8, visual assets, polish

**Structure Learning**:

- Book structure: Flat numbered files per chapter (`01-name.md`, `02-name.md`)
- NOT nested subdirectories (`lessons/01-name/README.md`)
- Confirmed by examining Chapter 5: `05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/01-origin-story.md`, etc.

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Complete Lesson 2 (Installing Zed) with Context7 /zed-industries/zed research
2. Complete Lesson 3 (Zed AI Features) with Three Roles INVISIBLE
3. Continue Lessons 4-8 sequentially
4. Visual assets (Phase 2 research, screenshots, diagrams)
5. Polish & validation (Phase 11)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase 1 infrastructure complete, Lesson 1 ready for students, correct structure established
- 🧪 Tests: Constitutional compliance validated (no meta-commentary, A2 cognitive load, observational approach)
- 📁 Files: 6 files created (README, Lesson 1, 2 templates, IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS, tasks.md updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue /sp.implement for Lessons 2-8 (sequential lesson-by-lesson approach recommended)
- 🧠 Reflection: Critical user feedback corrected fundamental structure error (nested lessons/ vs flat files); parallel subagent strategy yielded summaries not deliverables; scope requires iterative implementation (191 tasks too large for single session); Lesson 1 complete and constitutionally compliant

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Incorrect directory structure (nested lessons/ subdirectory instead of flat numbered files); parallel subagent outputs were summaries not deliverable content; underestimated scope for single session
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitutional compliance PASS (Lesson 1 validated: no meta-commentary, proper proficiency metadata, ends with "Practice" not exposition)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.implement with Context7 MCP requirement and antigravity.md context
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Sequential lesson-by-lesson implementation with educational-validator gate before filesystem write; create complete content in subagent prompts (not summaries); validate structure against existing chapters before generating
