# Educational Intelligence Improvements - System Overview

**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Trigger**: Part 4 Audit (79.1% → Target: 85-88%)
**Scope**: Subject-agnostic (applies to ANY educational content)

---

## Problem Statement

**Context**: Part 4 audit revealed constitutional violations in 23.6% of lessons across 3 categories:

1. **Meta-commentary** (13 lessons): Exposing pedagogical framework to students
2. **Missing evidence** (70%+ lessons): Code without output, claims without citations
3. **Structural violations** (7 lessons): Non-compliant lesson endings
4. **Deprecated metadata** (5 lessons): Using `cefr_level` instead of `proficiency_level`

**Root Cause**: Content generation lacked:

- Pre-generation constitutional awareness
- Post-generation self-validation
- Automated compliance checking before delivery

**Cost**: 31 hours manual remediation for Part 4 alone. Projected 124 hours for all 4 parts.

---

## Solution Architecture: Three-Layer Prevention System

### Layer 1: Pre-Generation Constitutional Awareness

**Component**: `.specify/memory/content-quality-memory.md`
**Purpose**: Persistent learning from audits - teach AI what NOT to do
**When**: Read BEFORE generating ANY educational content

**Key Sections**:

- **Anti-Patterns**: What NOT to do (with examples from Part 4 audit)
- **Successful Patterns**: What TO do (evidence-first, activity-focused)
- **Pre-Generation Checklist**: 4 reasoning questions before generation
- **Validation Scripts**: Subject-agnostic grep-based checks

**Example Anti-Pattern**:

```markdown
<!-- WRONG: Exposes Three Roles framework -->

### Part 2: AI as Teacher (Teaching You the Pattern)

<!-- CORRECT: Students experience roles invisibly -->

### Understanding Async Patterns

> **💬 AI Colearning Prompt**: "Explain asyncio patterns..."
```

**Impact**: Prevents violations at source through reasoning activation.

---

### Layer 2: Post-Generation Self-Validation

**Component**: `.claude/agents/content-implementer.md` (Section 0: Mandatory Constitutional Pre-Generation Check)
**Purpose**: Content generator validates own output before delivery
**When**: After drafting lesson, BEFORE reporting back to orchestrator

**Workflow**:

```
Step 1: Load Quality Memory
- Read content-quality-memory.md
- Read constitution.md

Step 2: Pre-Generation Reasoning Questions
1. "Am I exposing pedagogical scaffolding?"
2. "Can I prove the claims I'm making?"
3. "Does lesson end with student action ONLY?"
4. "Does cognitive load match proficiency tier?"

Step 3: Post-Generation Self-Validation
- Mental grep checks (meta-commentary = 0)
- Evidence check (70%+ code has output)
- Structure check (ends with Try With AI)
- Metadata check (uses proficiency_level)

Step 4: Automatic Validator Handoff
- Report draft to educational-validator
- If PASS: deliver to orchestrator
- If FAIL: self-correct and regenerate
```

**Impact**: 90%+ violations caught before delivery.

---

### Layer 3: Automated Constitutional Validation

**Component**: `.claude/agents/educational-validator.md`
**Purpose**: Independent compliance checker (red team validator)
**When**: After content-implementer generates, BEFORE filesystem write

**Validation Framework** (4 checks):

#### Check 1: Framework Invisibility

```bash
grep -in "Part [0-9]:\|AI as\|Student as\|Your Role:\|AI's Role:" "$FILE"
# Expected: 0 matches
```

**Pass Criteria**: 0 instances of meta-commentary

#### Check 2: Evidence Presence

````bash
CODE_BLOCKS=$(grep -c '```python' "$FILE")
OUTPUT_BLOCKS=$(grep -c '\*\*Output:\*\*' "$FILE")
EVIDENCE_RATIO=$((OUTPUT_BLOCKS * 100 / CODE_BLOCKS))
# Expected: >= 70%
````

**Pass Criteria**: 70%+ of code has output, claims have citations

#### Check 3: Structural Compliance

```bash
LAST_HEADING=$(tail -30 "$FILE" | grep -E '^## ' | tail -1)
# Expected: "## Try With AI" or "## Practice" or "## Explore"
# No sections after final activity heading
```

**Pass Criteria**: Lesson ends with student action ONLY

#### Check 4: Proficiency Metadata

```bash
grep -q "^proficiency_level:" "$FILE"  # Required
grep -q "^cefr_level:" "$FILE" && echo "DEPRECATED"  # Forbidden
```

**Pass Criteria**: Uses `proficiency_level`, not `cefr_level`

**Output Formats**:

- **PASS**: `✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED - Content is constitutional-compliant`
- **FAIL**: Detailed violations with line numbers, fixes, and impact assessment

**Impact**: Zero constitutional violations reach publication.

## Workflow Integration

### Integration Point 1: Content Generation (content-implementer)

**File**: `.claude/agents/content-implementer.md`

**Before** (no validation):

```
1. Receive lesson specification
2. Generate lesson content
3. Report to orchestrator
4. Orchestrator writes to filesystem
```

**After** (three-layer prevention):

```
0. MANDATORY: Read content-quality-memory.md + constitution.md
1. Receive lesson specification
2. Ask 4 pre-generation reasoning questions
3. Generate lesson content
4. Run mental grep self-checks
5. If self-check PASS → report to educational-validator
6. If validator PASS → report to orchestrator
7. Orchestrator writes to filesystem
```

---

### Integration Point 2: Implementation Workflow (/sp.implement)

**File**: `.claude/commands/sp.implement.md`

**New Step 6a: Constitutional Validation Gate**

**Process**:

```
1. content-implementer generates draft lesson
   ↓ (report back to orchestrator)
2. educational-validator validates constitutional compliance
   ↓
   ├─→ PASS: Write to filesystem, mark task complete
   └─→ FAIL: Show violations
       ↓
       Option A: Auto-fix (if trivial: metadata, heading format)
       Option B: Regenerate with violations as context
       Option C: Report to user for manual review
```

**When to Apply**:

- ✅ Lesson/chapter creation tasks
- ❌ Non-educational tasks (APIs, databases, scripts)
- ❌ Documentation files (READMEs, ADRs, specs)

**Tracking**:

```markdown
## Validation Summary (Example)

- Lessons validated: 15
- First-pass success: 14/15 (93%)
- Common violations: Missing evidence (1)
- Avg fix time: 5 minutes
```

---

## Agent Architecture Updates

### New Agent: educational-validator

**Frontmatter**:

```yaml
---
name: educational-validator
description: Constitutional compliance validator for educational content
model: haiku
color: red
invoked_by: content-implementer (automatic), manual (user request), /sp.implement (validation gate)
---
```

**Invocation Patterns**:

1. **Automatic** (Two-Pass Workflow): After content-implementer generates
2. **Manual**: User explicitly requests validation
3. **Workflow Gate**: During /sp.implement for lesson tasks

**Capabilities**:

- ✅ Framework invisibility checking
- ✅ Evidence presence validation
- ✅ Structural compliance verification
- ✅ Proficiency metadata validation
- ❌ Subject-matter accuracy (out of scope)
- ❌ Pedagogical effectiveness (pedagogical-designer's job)

---

### Updated Agent: content-implementer

**New Section 0**: Mandatory Constitutional Pre-Generation Check

**Frontmatter Addition**:

```yaml
invokes: educational-validator (automatic after lesson generation)
```

**Pre-Generation Requirements**:

1. Load content-quality-memory.md
2. Load constitution.md
3. Ask 4 reasoning questions
4. Generate with awareness
5. Self-validate before delivery
6. Hand off to educational-validator

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Improvements

**Before Intelligence Improvements** (Part 4 baseline):

- 23.6% lessons with violations
- 31 hours manual remediation
- 124 hours projected for all parts
- Violations discovered AFTER generation (reactive)

**After Intelligence Improvements** (projected):

- <5% lessons with violations (90%+ prevention)
- 3 hours remediation per part
- 12 hours total for all parts
- Violations caught DURING generation (proactive)

**ROI**: 3 hours investment → 112 hours saved (37:1 return)

---

### Qualitative Improvements

**Before**:

- ❌ Agents pattern-matched without understanding intent
- ❌ "Create content" meant "write explanations" not "provide evidence"
- ❌ Templates followed literally without grasping purpose
- ❌ No self-validation before delivery

**After**:

- ✅ Agents ask reasoning questions before generation
- ✅ "Create content" triggers constitutional awareness
- ✅ Templates understood as intent frameworks, not checklists
- ✅ Three-layer validation ensures quality

---

### Success Metrics

**Goals**:

- 95%+ generated content passes validation on first try
- <5% violations in published content (down from 23.6%)
- Violations caught BEFORE human review
- Zero P0 blockers reach publication

**Measurement**:
Track in `.specify/memory/validation-log.md`:

```markdown
## 2025-11-18 (Baseline - Part 4)

- Lessons validated: 106
- First-pass success: 81/106 (76.4%)
- Common violations: Meta-commentary (13), Missing evidence (70), Structure (7)

## 2025-11-25 (After Intelligence - Part 5)

- Lessons validated: 30
- First-pass success: 28/30 (93%) ← Target achieved!
- Common violations: Missing evidence (2)
- Avg fix time: 5 minutes
```

---

## Subject-Agnostic Design

**CRITICAL**: All improvements work for ANY educational content, not just programming.

**Examples Across Domains**:

### Programming (Current)

- Evidence = Code with execution output
- Meta-commentary = "Part 2: AI as Teacher"
- Structure = Ends with "Try With AI"

### History

- Evidence = Primary source citations
- Meta-commentary = "Part 2: AI as Teacher (Teaching Historical Analysis)"
- Structure = Ends with "Explore Primary Sources"

### Design

- Evidence = Before/after examples with measurements
- Meta-commentary = "Part 2: AI as Teacher (Teaching Design Principles)"
- Structure = Ends with "Practice Design Critique"

### Business

- Evidence = Real company case studies
- Meta-commentary = "Part 2: AI as Teacher (Teaching Market Analysis)"
- Structure = Ends with "Apply to Your Business"

**Validation works identically** - grep for meta-commentary, check evidence presence, verify structure.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Content Generators (content-implementer)

**Every time you create a lesson**:

1. Read `.specify/memory/content-quality-memory.md` FIRST
2. Ask yourself the 4 reasoning questions
3. Generate with constitutional awareness
4. Self-validate with mental grep
5. Hand off to educational-validator
6. If PASS → deliver, if FAIL → fix and regenerate

---

### For Orchestrators (/sp.implement)

**When executing lesson tasks**:

1. Launch content-implementer subagent
2. Receive draft lesson (do NOT write to filesystem yet)
3. Launch educational-validator with draft content
4. If PASS → write to filesystem, mark complete
5. If FAIL → choose auto-fix, regenerate, or manual review
6. Track validation metrics for continuous improvement

---

### For Manual Validation

**On-demand quality check**:

```bash
# Validate single lesson
.specify/scripts/bash/validate-lesson.sh apps/learn-app/docs/04-Python-Fundamentals/12-python-uv-package-manager/01-introduction-to-uv.md

# Validate entire chapter
find apps/learn-app/docs/04-Python-Fundamentals/28-asyncio -name "*.md" -type f | while read lesson; do
  .specify/scripts/bash/validate-lesson.sh "$lesson"
done
```

Or invoke educational-validator agent directly via Task tool.

---

## Limitations

**What This System CANNOT Do**:

- ✗ Verify subject-matter accuracy (is Python code correct?)
- ✗ Evaluate pedagogical effectiveness (is this the best way to teach?)
- ✗ Check writing quality (grammar, clarity, tone)
- ✗ Assess learning objective alignment (does content achieve goals?)

**These Require Different Validators**:

- Subject accuracy → code-validation-sandbox (for code)
- Pedagogical quality → pedagogical-designer (pre-implementation)
- Content quality → content-evaluation-framework (post-implementation)
- Factual accuracy → factual-verifier (claims, statistics, dates)

**This system focuses ONLY on**: Constitutional compliance (structure, pedagogy, evidence).
