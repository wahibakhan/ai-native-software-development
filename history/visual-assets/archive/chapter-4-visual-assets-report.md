## Pedagogical Assessment Results

All approved visuals passed the 4-criteria framework:

| Image                        | Teaching Value                                      | Constitutional Alignment                             | Message Clarity                                     | Non-Redundancy          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Nine Pillars Grid            | ✅ TEACH (shows structure of enabling technologies) | ✅ Pillar 1 (Nine Pillars) is constitutional core    | ✅ "Students understand nine enabling technologies" | ✅ Unique visualization |
| M-Shaped Profile Comparison  | ✅ TEACH (visualizes skill depth patterns)          | ✅ Supports Three-Role AI Partnership (Principle 18) | ✅ "Students distinguish M-shaped from T-shaped"    | ✅ Unique visualization |
| M-Shaped Profiles Examples   | ✅ TEACH (shows concrete domain combinations)       | ✅ Demonstrates Graduated Teaching (Principle 13)    | ✅ "Students see concrete M-shaped combinations"    | ✅ Unique visualization |
| Technology Adoption Timeline | ✅ TEACH (reveals historical pattern for urgency)   | ✅ Supports Progressive AI Integration (Principle 1) | ✅ "Students recognize early-adoption wins"         | ✅ Unique visualization |
| Learning Pathway Timeline    | ✅ TEACH (breaks complex learning into phases)      | ✅ Supports Graduated Teaching (Principle 13)        | ✅ "Students see realistic 18-month pathway"        | ✅ Unique visualization |

## Rejected Opportunities (With Rationale)

### Rejected 1: Nine Revolutions Grid (Lesson 1)

- **Reasoning**: Would create confusion between "nine revolutions" (historical context) and "nine pillars" (foundational technologies)
- **Pedagogical Assessment**: REJECT
- **Alternative**: Text list already clear and scannable

### Rejected 2: Nine AIDD Characteristics Grid (Lesson 2)

- **Reasoning**: These are DEFINING PRINCIPLES (abstract qualities) not ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES (concrete pillars); visual would amplify confusion by creating parallel "nine things" visuals
- **Pedagogical Assessment**: REJECT
- **Alternative**: Keep characteristics as text, reserve visual focus for pillars

### Rejected 3: Individual Pillar Deep Dive Diagrams (Lesson 4)

- **Reasoning**: Would create 9 fragmented visuals; one comprehensive grid (from Lesson 3) serves the entire chapter better; visual density of 9 images in one lesson would overwhelm
- **Pedagogical Assessment**: REJECT
- **Alternative**: One comprehensive diagram (nine-pillars-grid.png) represents all pillars
