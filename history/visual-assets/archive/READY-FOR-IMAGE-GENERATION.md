## READY Prompts (4 visuals)

All prompts below **PASSED** pedagogical value assessment and are embedded as HTML comments in lesson markdown files, ready for image-generator skill.

### ✅ Lesson 02, Visual 1: Developer Economy Calculation Flow

**File**: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/02-three-trillion-developer-economy.md`
**Location**: Line 65
**Type**: Horizontal flow diagram (3 cards with × and = connectors)
**Filename**: `developer-economy-calculation-breakdown.png`

**✨ Pedagogical Value**: PASS (HIGH VALUE)

- **Teaches**: Structure of how individual developer value compounds to aggregate economy through multiplication
- **Message**: "Developer value multiplies at scale: 30M individuals × $100K each = $3T total"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 13 (builds mental model of multiplication → aggregation causality)
- **Redundancy**: UNIQUE
- **Verdict**: Reveals causality structure (arrows show flow) not obvious from text equation

### ✅ Lesson 02, Visual 2: Technology Adoption Speed Acceleration (renumbered from Visual 3)

**File**: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/02-three-trillion-developer-economy.md`
**Location**: Line 318
**Type**: Horizontal timeline with descending staircase bars
**Filename**: `technology-adoption-speed-acceleration.png`

**✨ Pedagogical Value**: PASS (HIGH VALUE)

- **Teaches**: Exponential acceleration pattern across five technology waves
- **Message**: "Technology adoption is accelerating exponentially: 12y → 10y → 8y → 3y shows descending staircase pattern"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 13 (descending staircase metaphor teaches acceleration visually)
- **Redundancy**: UNIQUE
- **Verdict**: Descending pattern reveals acceleration structure that numbers alone don't convey

### ✅ Lesson 04, Visual 1: Development Lifecycle Transformation Dual-Track

**File**: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/04-development-lifecycle-transition.md`
**Location**: Line 79
**Type**: Dual-track process flow (traditional vs AI-augmented across 6 phases)
**Filename**: `development-lifecycle-transformation-diagram.png`

**✨ Pedagogical Value**: PASS (HIGH VALUE)

- **Teaches**: Systemic transformation across ALL six phases simultaneously, showing role convergence pattern
- **Message**: "AI transforms every development phase simultaneously, converging specialist roles into individual+AI partnerships"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 13 (dual-track shows before/after progression), Philosophy 2 (visualizes co-learning partnership structure)
- **Redundancy**: UNIQUE
- **Verdict**: Reveals "every phase" systemic pattern not graspable from sequential text descriptions

### ✅ Lesson 06, Visual 1: AI Coding Tools Evolution Timeline

**File**: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/06-autonomous-agent-era.md`
**Location**: Line 115
**Type**: Vertical timeline with generation cards and autonomy meter
**Filename**: `ai-coding-tools-evolution-timeline.png`
**Dimensions**: 9:16 vertical (1024x1792px)

**✨ Pedagogical Value**: PASS (HIGH VALUE)

- **Teaches**: Progression of autonomy across four generations with exponential autonomy growth pattern
- **Message**: "AI coding tools are progressing from 20% autonomy to 90% autonomy across four rapid generations, with 'we are here' at the Gen 3→4 transition point"
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Principle 13 (vertical timeline with autonomy meter builds progressive mental model)
- **Redundancy**: UNIQUE
- **Verdict**: Autonomy meter reveals hidden progression pattern (20%→40%→70%→90%) not obvious from generation descriptions

## REMOVED Prompts (2 visuals - failed pedagogical assessment)

### ❌ Lesson 02, Visual 2: GDP Comparison Bar Chart (REMOVED)

**Reason for removal**: REJECT (LOW VALUE)

- **Teaches**: Nothing (just displays magnitude comparison already stated in text)
- **Message**: "$3T is similar to major economies" (fact restatement, not concept)
- **Constitutional**: Fails Philosophy 2 (doesn't enable co-learning, purely illustrative)
- **Redundancy**: REDUNDANT with text ("$3T ≈ France GDP, India GDP, 40% China, 2× Canada" already clear in bullet list)
- **Action**: Removed from lesson markdown (text comparison sufficient)

### ❌ Lesson 03, Visual 1: Adoption Speed Grouped Bar Chart (REMOVED)

**Reason for removal**: REJECT (LOW VALUE)

- **Teaches**: Same concept as Lesson 02 Visual 3 (acceleration)
- **Message**: "AI tools adopt faster" (identical to Lesson 02 Visual 3)
- **Constitutional**: Redundant teaching (doesn't add to mental model already built)
- **Redundancy**: REDUNDANT_WITH_LESSON_02_VISUAL_3 (same data, same teaching goal, different layout provides no pedagogical value)
- **Action**: Removed from lesson markdown (use Lesson 02 descending staircase version only)

## Lessons Without Visuals (Correct Assessment)

### Lesson 05: Beyond Code - Changing Roles

**Visual Count**: 0
**Assessment**: ✅ Correct (narrative role transformation works best in text)

### Lesson 07: Opportunity Window

**Visual Count**: 0
**Assessment**: ✅ Correct (motivational/strategic content works best as narrative)

### Lesson 08: Traditional CS Education Gaps

**Visual Count**: 0
**Assessment**: ✅ Correct (argumentative/conceptual content works best in text)

6. ⏭️ Verify images render correctly in Docusaurus

### Future:

- Apply improved visual-asset-workflow to remaining chapters
- Gather learner feedback on visual teaching effectiveness during beta
- Consider interactive versions for web (if data supports it)

## Constitutional Compliance Summary

**Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching)**:

- ✅ All visuals build mental models progressively
- ✅ Visual complexity appropriate for A1-A2 proficiency level
- ✅ Descending patterns, dual-tracks, and flow diagrams teach structure

**Philosophy 2 (Co-Learning Partnership)**:

- ✅ Visuals enable AI-learner convergence (shared reference points)
- ✅ Visuals teach patterns student and AI can discuss together
- ✅ No decorative visuals (all have pedagogical purpose)

**Philosophy 4 (Evals-First)**:

- ✅ Visuals help students evaluate their understanding
- ✅ Students can point to visuals and articulate what they learned
- ✅ Clear teaching messages (testable comprehension)
