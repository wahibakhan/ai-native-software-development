description: Generate pedagogically-aligned slide decks from educational content using NotebookLM. Use when creating chapter slide presentations with proficiency-calibrated prompts. NOT for static slides or non-educational presentations.

# NotebookLM Slides Generation

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start browser (via browsing-with-playwright skill)
bash .claude/skills/browsing-with-playwright/scripts/start-server.sh

# 2. Navigate to NotebookLM
# browser_navigate to notebooklm.google.com

# 3. Create notebook, upload sources, generate slides
# Use proficiency-calibrated prompts below
```

## Core Principles

1. **Proficiency-Driven**: Slides match CEFR levels (A2 beginner → C1 advanced)
2. **Framework Alignment**: Educational philosophy explicitly stated
3. **Visual Over Text**: 3-5 bullets per slide, not paragraphs
4. **Narrative Arc**: problem → transformation → opportunity → action
5. **Actionable Endings**: Concrete next steps, not "Keep learning!"

## Workflow (Per Chapter)

| Step | Action                                          | Tool              |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1    | Navigate to notebooklm.google.com               | browser_navigate  |
| 2    | Create notebook: "Chapter X: Title"             | browser_click     |
| 3    | Upload ALL sources (lessons + README + quiz)    | browser_click     |
| 4    | Click "Slide Deck" in Studio panel              | browser_click     |
| 5    | Select "Presenter Slides" format                | browser_click     |
| 6    | Paste proficiency-calibrated prompt             | browser_type      |
| 7    | Click "Generate" (wait 5-30 min)                | browser_click     |
| 8    | Review with success criteria                    | Visual inspection |
| 9    | Download PDF                                    | browser_click     |
| 10   | Move to `static/slides/chapter-{NN}-slides.pdf` | Bash              |

## Proficiency-Calibrated Prompts

</slide_format_requirements>

END WITH: Production deployment strategies
```

## Success Criteria (7 Gates)

| Gate        | Check                | Pass                       | Fail                    |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1. Title    | Reflects framework?  | "AI Coding Revolution"     | "Introduction to AI"    |
| 2. Language | Matches proficiency? | A2: simple, no jargon      | A2 with technical terms |
| 3. Themes   | All 5-7 covered?     | Each theme with data       | Themes missing          |
| 4. Tone     | Matches spec?        | Encouraging (not academic) | Wrong emotional framing |
| 5. Count    | Within range?        | A2: 12-15, B1: 15-20       | Outside range           |
| 6. Arc      | Progression clear?   | problem → action           | Random sequence         |
| 7. Ending   | Actionable?          | Specific tasks             | "Keep learning!"        |

**Score**: 7/7 → Deploy | <7/7 → Iterate with refined prompt

## File Naming

**Format**: `chapter-{NN}-slides.pdf` (zero-padded)

```bash
# Example
mv ~/Downloads/"The-AI-Revolution.pdf" \
   "apps/learn-app/static/slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf"
```

## Integration

Add to chapter README frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Chapter 1: Title"
slides:
  source: "slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf"
  title: "Chapter 1: Title"
  height: 700
---
```

Build-time plugin auto-injects PDFViewer before "What You'll Learn".

## Batch Processing

For 3+ chapters:

1. Create ALL notebooks first (before generating)
2. Upload sources for all chapters
3. Prepare all prompts in text editor
4. Generate Chapter N → prepare N+1 prompt while waiting
5. Download when ready → start next immediately

**Daily limit**: 3-5 chapters/day (NotebookLM enforced)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Solution                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Generation stuck >30 min | Check browser console, verify no daily limit message |
| Text-heavy slides        | Add explicit "3-5 bullets, NOT paragraphs"           |
| Generic title            | Include example engaging title in prompt             |
| Missing themes           | List all themes numbered with specific data          |
| Daily limit hit          | Wait 24h (midnight PT reset), notebooks persist      |

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't                | Why                        | Do Instead                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Vague audience       | NotebookLM can't calibrate | "A2 beginners with no programming" |
| Skip framework       | Generic output             | Explicit 3-5 principles            |
| Single-word tone     | Ambiguous                  | "Encouraging (not intimidating)"   |
| Leave format default | Text-heavy slides          | Explicit bullet count              |
| Vague endings        | No student action          | Specific next steps                |
