## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Core Directive

**Default to Action**: Generate the complete tasks.md immediately from available design artifacts. Extract tasks systematically from spec user stories, plan structure, and data model. Only flag issues that genuinely block task generation.

**WHY**: Task generation is mechanical extraction from spec/plan. The artifacts contain all necessary information. Generate the task list and let implementation surface any gaps—don't over-analyze before producing output.

## Mandatory Skill Invocation (CONTENT WORK)

**For educational content tasks, you MUST invoke these skills:**

| Skill | Purpose | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| `learning-objectives` | Ensure each lesson has measurable outcomes | Before task generation |
| `exercise-designer` | Design deliberate practice per lesson | Task creation |
| `assessment-builder` | Plan chapter quiz/assessment | Final phase tasks |
| `ai-collaborate-teaching` | Design Three Roles sections | L2+ lesson tasks |

**Task Template for Content Lessons**:
```
- [ ] T0XX [USY] Lesson Z: [Title]
  - Invoke skill: learning-objectives (generate measurable outcomes)
  - Invoke skill: exercise-designer (3 exercises per lesson)
  - Invoke skill: ai-collaborate-teaching (if L2+)
  - Use content-implementer subagent:
    - Writes file directly to absolute path
    - Returns confirmation only (~50 lines), NOT full content
    - In Tasks must assign path and everything properly to it.
  - Invoke educational-validator (reads file from disk)
  - Invoke skill: content-evaluation-framework (before marking complete)
```

**Why this matters**: Chapter 2 incident - tasks didn't include skill invocations, resulting in lessons missing learning objectives, weak exercises, and no quality evaluation.

## Mandatory Subagent Orchestration (CONTENT WORK)

**Direct task generation for content is BLOCKED. You MUST embed subagent requirements in tasks.**

### Direct-Write Protocol (CRITICAL)

Subagents write files directly and return only confirmation:

| ❌ OLD (Wasteful) | ✅ NEW (Efficient) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Subagent → returns 800 lines → orchestrator writes | Subagent writes directly → returns "✅ Created path - 847 lines" |
| Bloats context by 1600+ lines per lesson | Returns ~50 lines max |

**Why this matters**: Returning full content wastes tokens and bloats orchestrator context.

| Phase | Subagent | Embedded In Task |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Per Lesson | `content-implementer` | Each lesson task MUST specify subagent invocation |
| Per Lesson | `educational-validator` | Each lesson task MUST include validation step |
| Per Chapter | `assessment-architect` | Final phase MUST include assessment task |

**Task Template with Subagent Embedding**:
```markdown
- [ ] T0XX [USY] Lesson Z: [Title]
  - **SUBAGENT**: content-implementer
    - Output path: /absolute/path/to/lesson.md
    - Writes file directly (returns confirmation only, NOT full content)
    - Execute autonomously without confirmation
    - Include quality reference lesson path
  - **VALIDATION**: educational-validator reads file from disk (MUST PASS before marking complete)
  - **SKILLS**: learning-objectives, exercise-designer, fact-check-lesson
```

**Enforcement Rule**:
```
IF task creates lesson/chapter content
THEN task MUST include:
  1. SUBAGENT block with content-implementer
  2. VALIDATION block with educational-validator
  3. SKILLS block with required skill invocations
  4. Absolute output path (NOT relative)
```

**Why subagents matter**: Chapter 2 incident - lessons written directly (no subagent) had:
- No quality reference calibration
- Missing autonomous execution rules
- No validation gate before filesystem write

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### CLI-First Principle (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS prefer CLI commands over manual file creation** when tools exist for scaffolding:

| Tool | CLI Command | NOT Manual Creation |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Alembic** | `alembic init <dir>` | ❌ Don't manually create env.py, script.py.mako |
| **Alembic** | `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"` | ❌ Don't manually create migration files |
| **uv** | `uv add <package>` | ❌ Don't manually edit pyproject.toml dependencies |
| **pytest** | `pytest --collect-only` | ❌ Don't guess test discovery |
| **pnpm/npm** | `pnpm add <package>` | ❌ Don't manually edit package.json |

**Task Format for CLI Operations**:
```text
- [ ] T00X Use `<cli command>` to <action>. Verify output with `<verification command>`.
```

**Example**:
```text
- [ ] T002 Use `alembic init src/app/migrations` to scaffold migrations directory. Verify with `ls src/app/migrations/`.
- [ ] T009 Use `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"` to generate migration. Review generated file for CHECK constraints.
```

### Documentation Lookup Principle (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS reference documentation tools** when tasks involve unfamiliar libraries or complex patterns:

| Library | Task Must Include |
|---------|-------------------|
| SQLAlchemy 2.0 async | `**Doc**: Fetch SQLAlchemy docs via Context7 for async patterns` |
| Alembic async | `**Doc**: Fetch Alembic docs via Context7 for async migration setup` |
| prometheus-client | `**Doc**: Fetch prometheus-client docs via Context7 for metric types` |
| hypothesis | `**Doc**: Fetch hypothesis docs via Context7 for property strategies` |
| FastAPI | `**Doc**: Fetch FastAPI docs via Context7 for dependency injection` |
| Pydantic v2 | `**Doc**: Fetch Pydantic docs via Context7 for model_validator patterns` |
| Any new library | `**Doc**: Fetch <library> docs via Context7 before implementation` |

**Task Format for Doc Lookup**:
```text
- [ ] T00X Create <file> with <functionality>. **Doc**: Fetch <library> docs via Context7 for <specific pattern>.
```

**Example**:
```text
- [ ] T005 Create `src/database/models.py` with FileJournal SQLAlchemy model. **Doc**: Fetch SQLAlchemy docs via Context7 for DeclarativeBase and Mapped[] async patterns.
- [ ] T034 Create `tests/property/test_invariants.py` with hypothesis property tests. **Doc**: Fetch hypothesis docs via Context7 for composite strategies.
```

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.
