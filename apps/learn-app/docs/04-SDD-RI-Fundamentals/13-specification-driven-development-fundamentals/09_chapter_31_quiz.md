    {
      question: "A developer writes 'Build a login system' as their prompt to an AI agent. After 10 iterations addressing missing password reset, rate limiting, and email verification, they've spent 12 hours. What core problem does this scenario demonstrate?",
      options: [
        "AI agents cannot generate authentication systems reliably enough",
        "The developer should have used better prompting",
        "Login systems require too many features for AI",
        "Vague prompts force iteration cycles that specifications prevent"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "This scenario illustrates the vague-code problem where unclear requirements force expensive iteration cycles. With a specification defining all requirements upfront (password reset, rate limiting, email verification), the AI could generate a complete system in one iteration, saving 8+ hours. The issue isn't AI capability or feature complexity, but the absence of explicit requirements. Better prompting won't fix inherently vague requirements—only specifications make implicit expectations explicit. The cost-benefit math shows: 1 hour spec + 3 hours refinement = 4 hours vs. 12 hours of iteration from vague prompts.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Vague Code and the AI Partner Problem"
    },
    {
      question: "Why do AI agents specifically need specifications more urgently than human developers do, according to the literal-mindedness principle?",
      options: [
        "AI agents require more detailed technical documentation overall",
        "Human developers always write better code than AI",
        "AI agents implement exactly specified requirements without inferring intent",
        "Specifications help AI agents learn programming patterns faster"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "AI literal-mindedness is the critical difference: human colleagues can infer unstated intent ('Did you want password reset?') and ask clarifying questions during development, but AI agents implement EXACTLY what you specify—no more, no less. If you don't mention password reset, AI assumes you don't want it. This isn't a limitation but how AI works. Human code quality and AI learning speed are separate issues. The need for detailed technical documentation applies to both humans and AI. The distinctive factor is that AI cannot improvise around vague requirements, making specifications mandatory rather than optional for AI-native development.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Vague Code and the AI Partner Problem"
    },
    {
      question: "Three developers implement password reset features. Developer A uses bcrypt (secure), B uses MD5 (insecure), C doesn't hash (catastrophic). Each spec said 'use secure hashing.' What specification problem does this reveal?",
      options: [
        "Specifications cannot prevent security vulnerabilities in distributed teams",
        "Feature-specific specs lack system-wide rules enforcing consistent interpretation",
        "Developers need more security training before writing specifications",
        "The original specifications were written with insufficient detail"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "This scenario demonstrates why Constitutions (system-wide rules) are essential. Each developer HAD a spec saying 'secure hashing,' but interpreted it differently because no Constitution defined what 'secure' means. A Constitution stating 'ALL passwords use bcrypt cost 12+' removes interpretation—everyone implements bcrypt, no debate. Security training doesn't solve interpretation variance. More detailed feature-specific specs don't scale (you'd repeat 'bcrypt' in 50 different specs). Specifications CAN prevent vulnerabilities when backed by constitutional enforcement. The problem isn't missing detail in individual specs, but missing global rules applying to ALL specs.",
      source: "Lesson 5: Your Team Needs Shared Rules"
    },
    {
      question: "A team discovers their password reset tokens don't expire, creating a critical security gap. They add a Constitution rule: 'All temporary access tokens MUST specify time-based expiry. Default: 30 minutes.' What pattern does this demonstrate?",
      options: [
        "Production bugs become constitutional rules preventing future recurrence",
        "Constitutional rules should address security issues after discovery",
        "Specifications need more comprehensive security testing from start",
        "Token expiry should have been in specification"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "This demonstrates organizational learning through constitutional evolution: Production bug → Root cause analysis (spec didn't specify token expiry) → Constitutional rule added (all temporary tokens must specify expiry) → Future specs automatically include expiry. The pattern is: encountering a gap once, encoding it as a rule, preventing recurrence across 50 features and 10 teams. While token expiry SHOULD have been in the original spec, that's not the pattern demonstrated—the insight is how teams systematically prevent repeated mistakes. Saying Constitutions should 'address issues after discovery' misses the preventive value. More comprehensive testing doesn't prevent specification gaps—only better specifications do.",

    },
    {
      question: "Model-Driven Development (MDD) in the 2000s promised automatic code generation from UML models but mostly failed. SDD succeeds where MDD failed. What fundamental difference explains this?",
      options: [
        "SDD has better testing frameworks than MDD provided",
        "UML models were too complex for developers to maintain",
        "2025 LLMs understand natural language better than MDD understood UML",
        "MDD used proprietary tools causing lock-in; SDD uses LLMs"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The fundamental difference is MDD's tool lock-in problem versus SDD's flexibility. MDD required custom code generators creating vendor dependency, models sat at awkward abstraction levels, and models/code diverged. SDD uses natural language specs (markdown/prose, not proprietary formats) that ANY LLM can process—no custom tools, less lock-in, faster feedback (spec changes → regenerated code in minutes, not hours). While 2025 LLMs ARE better at understanding nuance than 2004 code generators, this is a consequence of the tool flexibility, not the root cause. UML complexity and testing frameworks are secondary issues. The core failure was architectural: MDD locked teams into specific tools, SDD doesn't.",

    {
      question: "A spec states: 'divide(10, 2) should return 5.0' (not 5). What specification concept does this example demonstrate?",
      options: [
        "Type preservation rules require explicit specification details",
        "Edge cases must be documented for operations",
        "Acceptance criteria are executable contracts defining correctness",
        "Division operations always return float types consistently"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "This demonstrates that acceptance criteria are executable contracts: the spec isn't describing behavior, it's DEFINING what 'correct' means through a concrete test case. The specification that divide(10, 2) returns 5.0 (not 5) is a contract—it says division ALWAYS returns float, even when mathematically exact. While this relates to type preservation rules, the broader concept is that test scenarios ARE the specification in executable form. Edge cases are a different concept (boundary conditions like division by zero). Saying 'division operations always return float' describes behavior but misses the deeper insight: specifications define correctness through testable examples, not prose descriptions.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Build Your First Spec Together"
    },
    {
      question: "During calculator spec collaboration, AI asks: 'For subtract(a, b), does subtract(5, 3) return 2 or -2?' The developer clarifies: 'a - b, so subtract(5, 3) = 2.' What specification development pattern does this illustrate?",
      options: [
        "AI agents identify ambiguities that humans overlook in specs",
        "Collaborative iteration where questions reveal gaps converging on clarity",
        "AI requires more explicit instructions than human developers",
        "Specifications must define function parameter order precisely"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "This illustrates the convergence loop at specification level: AI identifies ambiguity → Developer clarifies → Spec improves through iteration. The pattern (AI asks questions → You clarify → Both improve spec together) is core to AI-native specification development. Neither could write the perfect spec alone—iteration produces production-ready specifications. While AI DOES identify ambiguities humans overlook, that's the mechanism, not the pattern. The statement about AI requiring explicit instructions is generally true but misses the collaborative convergence demonstrated. Parameter order precision is the specific issue resolved, not the general pattern shown. The key insight is iterative refinement through question-asking.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Build Your First Spec Together"
    },
    {
      question: "A team writes specs with edge cases fully documented (division by zero, floating-point precision, type handling). Later, when AI generates code, it correctly handles all edge cases. What specification principle does this demonstrate?",
      options: [
        "Comprehensive specifications enable first-iteration correct implementation success",
        "AI agents can infer edge case handling from",
        "Edge cases should be documented for clarity",
        "Type preservation rules prevent runtime errors effectively"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "This demonstrates specification primacy: when edge cases are explicit in specs, AI generates correct code in the first iteration because the specification removed ambiguity. The spec was clear enough that implementation became obvious and correct—AI didn't need to guess or ask questions during coding. While edge cases SHOULD be documented, this is a broader principle about specification completeness enabling success. AI cannot 'infer' edge case handling from context—that's precisely what specifications prevent. Type preservation rules are one aspect of edge cases, not the comprehensive principle. The key is that complete specifications (including edge cases) produce correct first implementations because clarity eliminates guesswork.",
      source: "Lesson 3: What is SDD"
    },
    {
      question: "Why did Specification-Driven Development emerge specifically in 2025 rather than in the 1970s (Formal Methods era), 2000s (MDD era), or 2010s (Agile era)?",
      options: [
        "Technology stack complexity required better documentation approaches now",
        "Developers finally recognized the value of writing specifications",
        "2025 AI agents became powerful and literal-minded simultaneously",
        "Formal Methods and MDD failed so teams tried"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "SDD emerged in 2025 because three forces converged: (1) AI got good enough to generate production code from specs, (2) developers discovered specs save iteration time (cost-benefit math finally works: 1-hour spec + 3-hour refinement = 4 hours vs. 12-hour vague-prompt iteration), and (3) AI literal-mindedness made specs mandatory—AI can't improvise like humans. Earlier spec approaches failed for different reasons: Formal Methods required PhD-level math, MDD created tool lock-in, Agile minimized specs losing institutional knowledge. Developer recognition and documentation needs existed before 2025. Technology complexity alone doesn't explain timing. The distinctive 2025 factor: AI agents both NEED explicit specs (literal-minded) and CAN execute them (powerful enough).",
      source: "Lesson 2: Why Do Specs Matter NOW?"
    },
    {
      question: "A specification states: 'API response must be &lt;100ms for user list endpoint.' What type of specification requirement is this?",
      options: [
        "Constraint limiting technical implementation approach choices",
        "Functional requirement describing what system should do",
        "Acceptance criteria for validating feature completion success",
        "Non-functional performance requirement defining system quality attributes"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "This is a non-functional requirement (NFR) specifying a quality attribute—performance—rather than what the system does. Functional requirements describe behavior ('system returns user list'), while NFRs describe quality characteristics (latency, security, scalability). While this COULD be used as acceptance criteria for validation, that's the usage, not the type. Constraints limit implementation choices ('must use PostgreSQL'), but this NFR defines a performance target without prescribing how to achieve it—you could optimize queries, add caching, or use better data structures. The distinction matters: functional requirements tell AI WHAT to build, NFRs tell AI quality targets to achieve.",
      source: "Lesson 3: What is SDD"
    },
    {
      question: "During spec-first development, a developer writes: 'add(a, b) returns int | float (preserves input types)' and 'divide(a, b) always returns float (consistency over type preservation).' What do these contrasting decisions demonstrate?",
      options: [
        "Specifications must define explicit design decisions with reasoning",
        "Type handling should be consistent across arithmetic operations",
        "Division operations require special handling in specifications",
        "Python type hints allow flexible return types"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "These contrasting decisions demonstrate that specifications force explicit design decisions with rationale. For addition, the designer chose type preservation (int + int = int); for division, the designer chose consistency (always float, even when exact). Both are valid designs, but the spec makes the choice explicit rather than leaving AI to guess. Consistency ACROSS operations isn't shown here—the decisions deliberately differ based on reasoning. Division doesn't universally require special handling; this spec made a specific choice. Python type hints enable flexibility, but that's the mechanism, not the lesson. The core insight: specifications aren't just documentation—they're where you encode design decisions that AI will implement. The rationale ('consistency over type preservation') shows thoughtful decision-making.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Build Your First Spec Together"
    },
    {
      question: "A Constitution states: 'All API specs MUST define error response format.' A developer's API spec omits error responses. During review, what should happen?",
      options: [
        "Developer adds error responses during implementation instead",
        "Spec rejected until error responses added per rules",
        "Constitution rule updated to be more flexible",
        "Error responses added as optional enhancement later"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Constitutional compliance is enforced at spec time, not implementation time—the spec should be rejected until error responses are added per Constitution. This is the enforcement mechanism that makes Constitutions effective: quality rules apply to ALL specs, no exceptions. If developers can skip Constitution rules during spec-writing and 'add them during implementation,' the Constitution has no teeth—quality becomes optional. Updating Constitution rules to be more flexible defeats the purpose of having consistent quality standards. Making error responses 'optional enhancements' contradicts the Constitution's MUST requirement. The value of Constitutions is preventing quality gaps before they become code. Spec-time enforcement ensures every feature meets minimum quality standards from the start.",
      source: "Lesson 5: Your Team Needs Shared Rules"
    },
    {
      question: "A pattern appears in 30 different specifications: 'API endpoints require definition of endpoints, error handling, authentication, and rate limiting.' What does this recurrence suggest?",
      options: [
        "This pattern indicates need for API standardization",
        "API specifications are too complex and need",
        "Developers should use API specification template",
        "This pattern should become reusable intelligence component"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "When a pattern recurs across 30 specs (80%+ of features), it should become Reusable Intelligence—either a Skill (guidance with 2-4 decision points) or a Subagent (autonomous reasoning with 5+ decision points). This encodes institutional knowledge once rather than rewriting it 30 times. Templates help but don't provide reasoning; they're static while RI components guide context-specific decisions. Saying 'API specs are too complex' misses the point—complexity isn't reduced by ignoring it, but by encoding expertise once and reusing it. Standardization is related but not the pattern demonstrated—the insight is recognizing when repeated patterns justify creating reusable intelligence. The threshold: patterns recurring 2+ times with 2+ decision points merit consideration.",
      source: "Lesson 6: Introduction to Reusable Intelligence"
    },
    {
      question: "What distinguishes a Skill (providing guidance) from a Subagent (autonomous reasoning) in the Reusable Intelligence framework?",
      options: [
        "Skills provide templates; Subagents generate complete code",
        "Skills are simpler; Subagents handle complex problems",
        "Skills have two to four decision points; Subagents five-plus",
        "Skills apply broadly; Subagents are domain-specific only"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The defining distinction is decision points: Skills handle 2-4 decisions (human decides with guidance), Subagents handle 5+ decisions (AI reasons autonomously). Example: Input Validation Skill (2-4 decisions: valid types? ranges? error handling? strict/lenient?) provides guidance; Performance Optimization Subagent (5+ decisions: volumes? latency? N+1? caching? memory? structures?) reasons autonomously. While Skills ARE typically simpler and Subagents handle complexity, this is a consequence of decision point count, not the definition. Skills don't just provide templates—they guide reasoning. Subagents don't generate code—they analyze specs and make recommendations. Skills CAN be domain-specific (not just broad), and Subagents CAN apply broadly (not just vertically). Decision point count is the architectural threshold.",

    {
      question: "In P+Q+P pattern design, a Persona states: 'You are an expert in programming.' Why is this considered a weak Persona?",
      options: [
        "Lacks specific cognitive stance activating particular thinking pattern",
        "Too generic to provide useful AI guidance",
        "Does not specify domain expertise level",
        "Fails to establish authority for recommendations"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "This Persona is weak because it lacks cognitive stance—it doesn't activate a SPECIFIC thinking pattern. Compare: 'You are an expert' (generic) vs. 'You are a defensive programming specialist focused on attack surfaces. Think about validation the way a security auditor thinks about vulnerabilities' (activates defensive, security-first reasoning). The strong version establishes HOW to think, not just WHAT to know. While 'too generic' is related, the deeper issue is absence of cognitive framing. Domain expertise level matters less than thinking approach. Authority for recommendations isn't the Persona's purpose—establishing reasoning stance is. The goal: shift AI from pattern-matching mode ('retrieve generic expert knowledge') to reasoning mode ('analyze THIS context defensively').",

      question: "A Security Review Subagent's Questions section includes: 'What are actual threat actors? What's compliance requirement? What's deployment timeline?' Why are these questions effective?",
      options: [
        "Questions cover all security domains comprehensively",
        "Questions force context-specific analysis instead of generic patterns",
        "Questions help AI understand the problem",
        "Questions reduce need for human security expertise"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "These questions are effective because they force context-specific analysis: 'What are YOUR actual threat actors? (script kiddies, targeted attackers, nation-states?)' demands reasoning about THIS situation, not retrieving generic security patterns. Weak questions like 'Is this secure?' encourage pattern-matching; strong questions like 'What's OUR compliance requirement? (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, none?)' force situation-specific reasoning. While these questions DO cover important security domains, comprehensiveness isn't what makes them effective—contextual forcing is. Questions help AI understand the problem, but that's the goal, not the mechanism. Questions don't reduce human expertise—they activate it systematically. The design principle: questions should be answerable only with knowledge of YOUR specific context.",

      question: "An Input Validation Skill includes the Principle: 'Validate at system boundaries (prevent bad data from entering).' Why is this a strong Principle?",

        "States best practice that all developers recognize",
        "Provides decision framework with clear reasoning about where",
        "Reduces validation code duplication across the system"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "This is a strong Principle because it provides a decision framework with clear reasoning: 'WHERE should validation happen? At boundaries (API endpoints, user inputs, file uploads) to prevent bad data from entering.' It guides a SPECIFIC decision (location) with a REASON (prevention). Weak principles like 'Use best practices' or 'Make it secure' offer no guidance. While this IS a recognized best practice, recognition doesn't make it strong—actionability does. It DOES prevent vulnerabilities, but that's the outcome, not what makes it a strong Principle. Code duplication reduction is a benefit, not the framework's purpose. The pattern: strong Principles answer specific questions ('where to validate?') with reasoning ('because boundaries prevent contamination'), enabling consistent decisions across contexts.",

        "Provide audit trail for regulatory compliance requirements",
        "Help debug AI-generated code when bugs occur",
        "Capture AI interactions to enable organizational learning"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "PHRs' primary purpose is organizational learning: tracking AI interactions reveals which prompts produce better results, enabling teams to learn from patterns. Example: 'Prompts with explicit error handling: 95% success. Prompts without: 60% success → Team learns: always specify error handling.' While PHRs DO provide audit trails for compliance (secondary benefit), that's not the primary purpose. PHRs HELP debugging by showing what was asked and generated, but that's reactive use, not the design purpose. Documenting prompts for reuse is closer, but misses the learning aspect—it's not just reuse, but learning WHY some prompts work better. The pattern: PHR analysis over time reveals success factors, converting individual interactions into institutional knowledge.",

        "Enterprise compliance requires Spec-Kit constitutional enforcement"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The 50-person team needs constitutional governance because Spec-Kit's Constitution enforces consistency across all features—'All passwords use bcrypt' applies to 50 developers without constant meetings. Kiro's simplicity is an advantage for 1-3 developers but doesn't scale to 50 (you get simplicity, sacrifice governance). While Kiro IS 'too simple' for enterprise scale, the specific mechanism is lack of governance, not general complexity. Documentation quality isn't the differentiator—governance is. Compliance doesn't universally require Spec-Kit (you could meet compliance with any framework), but constitutional enforcement makes compliance consistent and measurable. The decision factor: team size (50 developers) creates need for shared rules ensuring consistency. Context determines framework fit.",

      question: "A developer spends 30 minutes writing a vague prompt and then 10 hours iterating. An alternative: 1 hour writing a spec + 3 hours refinement. At what iteration count does the spec approach break even?",
      options: [
        "Spec approach is immediately faster with comprehensive savings",
        "Break-even occurs after approximately two complete iterations",
        "Requires three iterations before spec becomes worthwhile",
        "Only valuable for projects exceeding four iterations"

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The spec approach is immediately faster: 0.5-hour vague prompt + 10-hour iteration = 10.5 hours total vs. 1-hour spec + 3-hour refinement = 4 hours total. Savings: 6.5 hours (62% faster) on the FIRST attempt—no break-even calculation needed. The cost-benefit math shows specifications save time from iteration 1, not after multiple iterations. This assumes the vague approach requires ~10 hours of iteration (realistic for complex features) while the spec approach needs only ~3 hours of refinement (because requirements were clear upfront). The break-even question misframes the analysis—specs aren't an investment that pays off after multiple uses, they're immediately cheaper because they prevent iteration waste from the start.",

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The 'No Implementation Details' criterion prevents specs from prescribing HOW to build, focusing instead on WHAT and WHY. Example: Spec saying 'use bcrypt with 12 rounds' (HOW) is too prescriptive—better: 'passwords must be securely hashed' (WHAT) + Constitution: 'secure hashing = bcrypt cost 12+' (HOW, system-wide). This lets different AI agents implement correctly using different approaches while meeting the intent. Implementation details don't make specs 'too long'—they make them inflexible. Non-technical stakeholder confusion is a side concern, not the primary issue. AI CAN understand implementation-specific instructions—the problem is those instructions prevent alternative valid implementations. Specifications should define INTENT ('secure authentication') not IMPLEMENTATION ('use JWT with RS256').",

      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "This failure reveals that ambiguous specs let AI make assumptions (AI interpreted 'preserve types' as 'use float for consistency'), exposing the specification gap. When AI generated wrong code, it wasn't AI's fault—the spec was ambiguous. The developer then refined the spec with examples: '❌ DON'T: return float(a + b) // Loses int type. ✅ DO: return a + b // Python preserves naturally.' This is the convergence loop: failure reveals ambiguity → refine spec → AI regenerates correctly. While AI DOES need explicit instructions, that's the general principle, not the specific pattern shown. Type preservation isn't too complex—it just needs clear specification. Testing would catch the error but doesn't prevent it; clearer specs do.",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The most likely problem is inconsistent security and architecture decisions: each developer makes independent choices (bcrypt vs. MD5 vs. nothing; JWT vs. sessions; different error patterns) creating technical debt and security gaps. Constitutions solve this by establishing shared rules ('ALL passwords use bcrypt') everyone follows. Slower speed isn't the primary issue—inconsistency is. Code duplication is a symptom, not the core problem. Onboarding difficulty is a consequence of inconsistency. The pattern: without shared rules, 5 developers make 5 different security decisions for similar features, creating chaos. With Constitution, they make the SAME decision automatically. The scaling principle: more developers → greater need for shared rules. At 1 developer, no Constitution needed; at 50 developers, Constitution essential.",

      question: "What is the relationship between Constitutions and Reusable Intelligence components (Skills/Subagents)?",
      options: [
        "Constitution applies globally; RI components apply to contexts",
        "Constitution enforces quality; RI components implement patterns repeatedly",
        "Constitution defines system-wide rules; RI components encode domain expertise",
        "Constitution prevents inconsistency; RI components enable reusability"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The relationship: Constitution defines system-wide rules applying to ALL features ('All passwords use bcrypt,' 'All API specs define error responses'), while RI components encode domain expertise as reusable patterns (Input Validation Skill, Performance Optimization Subagent). Constitution is governance (what rules apply everywhere?), RI is expertise (what patterns recur, how do we encode them?). They're complementary: Constitution ensures consistency (everyone follows same security rules), RI provides efficiency (don't rebuild validation logic 30 times). While Constitution enforces quality and RI implements patterns, this misses the governance vs. expertise distinction. Global vs. specific contexts is related but incomplete—RI components can be broadly applicable (horizontal) or domain-specific (vertical). Preventing inconsistency vs. enabling reusability describes outcomes, not the fundamental relationship. The architecture: Constitution = mandatory rules, RI = encoded expertise.",

      question: "A developer writes acceptance criteria: 'System should handle large numbers efficiently.' Why is this criterion weak?",
      options: [
        "Not testable: lacks specific threshold defining success measurably",
        "Too vague: doesn't specify what large means",
        "Missing context: doesn't explain why efficiency matters",
        "Incomplete: doesn't specify performance requirements explicitly"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "This criterion is weak because it's not testable—you can't write a test proving success without a specific threshold. 'Handle large numbers efficiently' has no measurable definition: What's 'large' (1000? 1,000,000? 10^100?)? What's 'efficiently' (&lt;100ms? &lt;1s? &lt;1hr?)? Strong acceptance criteria: 'GIVEN calculator initialized, WHEN multiply(999999, 999999), THEN result returned in &lt;50ms.' This is testable—you can write a test proving success or failure. While vagueness is the problem, 'not testable' captures the specification failure most precisely. Missing context about why efficiency matters is a separate issue. Incomplete performance requirements is true but doesn't capture the testability issue specifically. The design principle: acceptance criteria should be specific enough that you can write automated tests proving them true or false.",

      question: "Spec-Kit Plus is described as 'Spec-Kit foundation + Intelligence Layers for AI-native teams.' What makes it specifically suited for AI-native development compared to traditional development?",

        "Provides governance and traceability required for AI",
        "ADRs capture reasoning; PHRs log AI interactions for",
        "Intelligence Templates guide AI agent decision-making effectively",
        "Combines human reasoning with AI interaction tracking"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Spec-Kit Plus suits AI-native development because: ADRs capture architectural reasoning (why we chose THIS approach—important when AI agents implement multiple features and need to understand past decisions), PHRs log ALL AI interactions (what prompt → what response → accepted/modified/why—enables learning 'Prompt A produced vulnerable code, Prompt B fixed it, use B next time'), and Intelligence Templates encode domain expertise (AI agents read healthcare template, know HIPAA rules before coding). Traditional development doesn't need PHRs (no AI interactions to log) or reasoning-activated templates (humans apply domain knowledge intuitively). While governance and traceability ARE required, the AI-specific features are ADR-guided agent decisions and PHR-logged interaction learning. Templates DO guide AI, but the complete system (ADRs + PHRs + Templates together) is what makes it AI-native.",

      question: "Why is convergence at specification level (before implementation) more valuable than convergence at code level (after implementation)?",
      options: [
        "Collaboration at spec level produces better understanding",
        "Specifications are easier to change than implementations",
        "Earlier feedback reduces cost of changes later",
        "Prevents iteration waste by clarifying requirements before code generation"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Convergence at spec level prevents iteration waste: when AI asks 'Does subtract(5, 3) return 2 or -2?' BEFORE generating code, you clarify once and code generated correctly. Convergence at code level means: AI generates code implementing wrong assumption → you test → discover error → AI regenerates → test again. The vague prompt problem repeated. While specs ARE easier to change than code, that's a mechanism, not the value. Earlier feedback reducing cost is related but doesn't capture the iteration prevention specifically. Collaboration producing better understanding is true but not the efficiency advantage. The pattern: spec convergence (AI asks → you clarify → spec improves → code generated correctly) vs. code convergence (AI generates → you test → find error → regen iterate). Spec convergence is cheaper because clarification happens BEFORE expensive generation.",

      question: "A Performance Optimization Subagent analyzes a feature and recommends: 'N+1 query risk detected. Expected impact: 1000+ queries per user. Recommend eager loading with join.' What demonstrates this is autonomous reasoning, not pattern matching?",
      options: [
        "Identification of N+1 problem through code review",
        "Recommendation based on feature-specific query analysis performed",
        "Context-specific analysis combining data volumes, query patterns, impact",
        "Performance impact calculation showing thousand-query problem scale"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "This demonstrates autonomous reasoning because the Subagent: (1) analyzed context ('THIS feature's data volumes'), (2) identified pattern ('N+1 query risk in THIS code'), (3) calculated impact ('1000+ queries per user' based on expected scale), and (4) recommended solution ('eager loading with join' matching THIS context). Pattern matching would retrieve 'N+1 is bad, use eager loading' without analyzing whether it applies HERE. Reasoning evaluates: Is this ACTUALLY an N+1 problem? What's the impact given OUR volumes? Is optimization justified? Recommendation alone doesn't show reasoning (could be pattern-matching template). Identification alone doesn't show reasoning (could be pattern recognition). Impact calculation is part of reasoning but not the complete demonstration. The distinction: reasoning analyzes YOUR specific context; pattern matching retrieves generic advice.",
