# Anatomy of a Specification

In Lesson 1, you learned that vague specifications cost time, money, and sanity. Your AI companion built something technically correct but wrong for your actual needs.

**Here's the key insight**: Clarity prevents miscommunication.

In this lesson, you'll learn to structure that clarity. You'll discover what a professional specification looks like, why success criteria belong FIRST (not last), and how to write your own spec.md file by hand.

This is **manual foundation work** — building your understanding before AI collaboration. No AI agents. Just you, a blank document, and the structure that turns vague ideas into executable plans.

---

## What Makes a Specification

A **specification** (or spec) is a structured, behavior-oriented document that clearly describes what a feature should do, under what constraints, and how you'll know it's correct.

**Not just any document** — a real spec:

- ✅ **Has clear intent** — "What problem does this solve?"
- ✅ **Defines constraints** — "What must ALWAYS be true?"
- ✅ **Includes acceptance criteria** — "How do we verify it works?"
- ✅ **Is testable** — "Can we write automated tests from this?"
- ✅ **Survives iteration** — "Can we reference this 6 months from now?"

**What it's NOT**:
- ❌ A brainstorm document (too vague)
- ❌ A detailed prompt to an AI (one-time use, not reusable)
- ❌ Source code (belongs in the codebase, not the spec)

---

## What Is Specification-Driven Development?

**Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** is a software development workflow where you write specifications BEFORE code, treating specs as the primary source of truth.

**The SDD Workflow**:
1. **Write spec first** → Define intent, constraints, success criteria
2. **Generate/write code** → Implementation from spec
3. **Validate** → Verify code matches spec acceptance criteria
4. **Iterate** → Refine spec if requirements change, regenerate code

**Key Principle**: Code is the OUTPUT of specification, not the INPUT. The spec comes first, always.

**How SDD Differs from Other Approaches**:

| Approach | Workflow | Problem |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Vibe coding** | Prompt → hope | No structured spec, AI guesses intent |
| **Code-first** | Code → documentation | Spec written after code exists (reactive) |
| **Traditional TDD** | Tests → code | Tests guide code, but no overarching spec |
| **SDD** | Spec → tests + code | Specification guides both implementation AND validation |

In SDD, the **specification** is the authoritative document that drives both your tests and your implementation.

---

## The Evals-First Principle

Here's the core insight that makes SDD work: **You define success criteria BEFORE you implement.**

This is called the **evals-first principle**.

### Why Evals-First?

When you write acceptance criteria first, you create a contract between yourself and the implementation:

1. **Clarity**: You force yourself to think about success, not just the happy path
2. **Validation**: You have a concrete checklist to verify the implementation works
3. **Debugging**: When something fails, you know exactly what it was supposed to do
4. **Handoff**: Other team members (or AI agents) can verify correctness independently

### Evals Come BEFORE Code

**Wrong approach** (implementation-first):
```
1. Write code
2. Test it
3. Hope it matches intent
4. (Optional) Write success criteria retrospectively
```

**Right approach** (evals-first):
```
1. Define success criteria (acceptance tests)
2. Specify constraints and edge cases
3. Generate/write code
4. Verify against success criteria
```

### Example: Configuration File Manager

**WITHOUT evals-first** (vague):
```
Add a feature to save and load app settings
```

**WITH evals-first** (specific):
```
Acceptance Criteria:
- Function saves Python dict to JSON file without errors
- Function loads JSON file and returns dict with correct keys/values
- Function creates file if it doesn't exist (with default settings)
- Function handles missing files gracefully (raises FileNotFoundError)
- Function validates JSON format before loading (catches JSONDecodeError)
```

When you write these criteria first, you're writing your acceptance tests. The implementation must satisfy all of them. This is evals-first.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In production software, "we'll figure out success later" is how projects slip schedules. Evals-first forces clarity upfront. It's harder initially but saves massive rework later.

## Anatomy of a Specification

A production-ready spec.md file has these sections:

![Diagram showing four core sections of a specification: Intent, Success Criteria, Constraints, and Non-Goals, with examples illustrating each section](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-4/chapter-13/spec-anatomy-four-sections.png)

### 1. Intent (What problem does this solve?)

```
One sentence capturing the purpose.
Why is this feature worth building? What user need does it address?
```

**Example**:
> "Applications need to persist user preferences (theme, font size, log level) across sessions without requiring environment variables or command-line arguments."

### 2. Success Criteria (How do we know it works?)

```
Bulleted list of verifiable outcomes.
Each criterion should be testable, not vague.
```

**Example**:
```
- save_config(settings: dict) saves dict to config.json without errors
- load_config() returns dict with all keys from previous save
- load_config() returns default_settings if config.json doesn't exist
- load_config() raises JSONDecodeError if config.json is corrupted
- Settings persist across multiple program runs
```

### 3. Constraints (What must always be true?)

```
Non-negotiable requirements that limit implementation choices.
These can include technology choices when justified.
```

**Example**:
```
- Must use only built-in Python json module (no external libraries)
- Config file must be valid JSON (parseable without errors)
- Must handle file permission errors gracefully (e.g., read-only files)
- Must not allow null values in configuration settings
```

**When to include tech stack in constraints**:
- ✅ **DO specify** when technology choice matters: "Must use Python's json module (deployment environment restrictions)"
- ✅ **DO specify** when team expertise limits options: "Must use PostgreSQL (team familiar with SQL)"
- ❌ **DON'T over-specify** when intent is general: Don't say "Use React with Redux" when "Build interactive web UI" is sufficient

**Good constraint**: Balances intent (general problem) with justified technical boundaries (specific tooling when required).

### 4. Non-Goals (What's intentionally NOT included?)

```
Features explicitly deferred or out of scope.
Prevents scope creep during implementation.
```

**Example**:
```
- Encryption of config file (plain JSON for MVP)
- Configuration versioning/migration logic (v2)
- GUI config editor (command-line only)
- Cloud sync across devices (v2)
```

---

## Example: Configuration File Manager Specification

Here's a real specification for a configuration file manager, with explanations of each section:

```markdown
# Specification: Configuration File Manager

## Intent

Python applications need a way to save and load user settings (log level, output format, timeout values) across program runs without hardcoding values or requiring command-line arguments every time. This feature allows applications to persist configuration to a JSON file and restore it on startup.

**Why this matters**: Settings persistence improves user experience (no reconfiguration every run) and enables production-ready applications (production apps store config separately from code).

---

## Success Criteria (Acceptance Tests)

- save_config(settings: dict, filename: str) writes settings dict to JSON file without errors
- load_config(filename: str) returns dict with all keys/values from saved file
- load_config(filename: str) returns default settings dict if file doesn't exist
- load_config(filename: str) raises FileNotFoundError if filename is invalid
- Settings persist correctly across multiple program runs (verify by running program twice)
- Function handles UTF-8 encoded text correctly

**Why these criteria?**: Each criterion is testable and measurable. We can write automated tests that verify file operations, error handling, and data integrity.

---

## Constraints

- Must use only Python's built-in json module (no external libraries like pyyaml)
- Config file must be valid JSON (parseable by json.loads without errors)
- Must handle file permission errors gracefully (read-only files on Unix systems)
- Default settings must include all required keys (no partial configs)
- Must work with both relative paths (config.json) and absolute paths (/home/user/.myapp/config.json)

**Why constraints?**: These limit implementation choices and ensure robustness. "Built-in only" prevents dependency bloat; "handle permissions" ensures Unix/Linux compatibility; "absolute and relative paths" ensures flexibility.

---

## Non-Goals (Intentionally Deferred)

- Encryption of config file (plain JSON for MVP, v2 if needed)
- Configuration versioning/migration (v2 when schema changes)
- GUI config editor (command-line only)
- Cloud sync across devices (v2)

**Why non-goals?**: Prevents scope creep. MVP version keeps it simple (plain JSON); encryption/versioning/sync add complexity that can wait.

---

## Implementation Considerations

- Default settings location: `config.json` in current working directory (or configurable path)
- File encoding: UTF-8 (supports non-ASCII characters)
- Error handling: Catch FileNotFoundError (file doesn't exist), JSONDecodeError (invalid JSON)
- Return type: dict (Python native data structure)
- Function signatures:
  ```python
  def save_config(settings: dict, filename: str = "config.json") -> None:
      """Save settings dict to JSON file."""

  def load_config(filename: str = "config.json", defaults: dict = None) -> dict:
      """Load settings from JSON file, return defaults if file missing."""
  ```

---

## Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Steps | Expected Result |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Save new config | Call save_config(\{"log_level": "DEBUG"\}) | config.json created with JSON content |
| Load existing config | Call load_config() after save | Returns \{"log_level": "DEBUG"\} |
| Load missing file | Call load_config("missing.json") | Returns default_settings dict |
| Load corrupted JSON | File contains invalid JSON; call load_config() | Raises JSONDecodeError with message |
| Load with absolute path | Call load_config("/tmp/app_config.json") | Correctly reads from absolute path |
| Permission denied (Unix) | Config file has read-only permissions; call load_config() | Raises PermissionError |

### What This Specification Contains

**Section 1 (Intent)**: Answers "why are we building this?"
- ✅ Specific problem (settings need to persist across runs)
- ✅ Production context (production apps store config separately from code)

**Section 2 (Success Criteria)**: These become your acceptance tests
- ✅ Each criterion is testable (can write automated tests for file I/O, error handling, persistence)
- ✅ You can write automated tests that verify these
- ✅ No ambiguity ("returns dict with all keys/values" is measurable, not "works correctly")

**Section 3 (Constraints)**: These guide implementation decisions
- ✅ "Built-in json module only" limits technology choices (prevents external dependency bloat)
- ✅ "Handle file permissions" ensures cross-platform robustness
- ✅ "Support relative and absolute paths" enables flexibility

**Section 4 (Non-Goals)**: This prevents scope creep
- ✅ "Encryption in v2" defers complexity to later release
- ✅ "CLI only (no GUI)" keeps MVP scope focused

**Implementation notes**: Technical context for whoever builds this

**Test scenarios**: Concrete examples of how success criteria play out

## Quality Awareness — Good Specs vs Bad Specs

You've seen what a good specification looks like. But how do you recognize a **bad spec**—and more importantly, how do you fix it?

Quality isn't about length or formality. It's about **clarity, testability, and completeness**.

### Good Spec vs Bad Spec Comparison

**❌ Bad Spec (Vague Intent)**:
```
Make the system fast
```

**Problem**: "Fast" is subjective. Fast for what? How fast? Measured how?

**✅ Good Spec (Clear Intent)**:
```
API response time must be &lt;200ms for 95th percentile of requests under normal load (1000 req/sec)
```

**Why better**: Measurable (200ms), specific percentile (95th), defined load (1000 req/sec).

---

**❌ Bad Spec (Untestable Success Criteria)**:
```
UI should look good and be user-friendly
```

**Problem**: "Look good" and "user-friendly" are opinions, not testable criteria.

**✅ Good Spec (Testable Success Criteria)**:
```
- All buttons have 8px padding and use primary color #007bff
- Font size is 16px minimum for body text (WCAG AA compliance)
- All interactive elements have 44x44px touch targets (mobile accessibility)
```

**Why better**: Concrete measurements (8px, 16px, 44x44px), verifiable (color code, WCAG standard).

---

**❌ Bad Spec (Missing Constraints)**:
```
Save user data to file
```

**Problem**: What format? What encoding? What happens if file exists? If disk is full?

**✅ Good Spec (Explicit Constraints)**:
```
- File format: JSON (UTF-8 encoding)
- If file exists: Overwrite with new data
- If disk full: Raise OSError with clear message
- File path: Relative paths resolved from current working directory
```

**Why better**: No ambiguity. Every edge case addressed.

---

**❌ Bad Spec (Over-Specification)**:
```
Use PostgreSQL 14.2 with connection pooling (pgbouncer) on port 5432,
with max_connections=200, shared_buffers=256MB, effective_cache_size=1GB
```

**Problem**: Over-constrains implementation. What if PostgreSQL 15 is better? What if pooling isn't needed?

**✅ Good Spec (Balanced Constraints)**:
```
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+ (team expertise, production environment)
- Connection management: Must support concurrent connections (implementation flexible)
```

**Why better**: Specifies intent (concurrent connections) with justified technology choice (PostgreSQL 14+), without micromanaging configuration.

---

### Quality Checklist for Specifications

Before finalizing any spec, validate against these criteria:

#### 1. Clear Intent?
- ✅ Answers "What problem does this solve?"
- ✅ Explains why this feature matters (user value, business need)
- ❌ Avoid: Vague statements like "improve user experience" without specifics

**Self-Check**: Can someone unfamiliar with the project understand the purpose in 30 seconds?

#### 2. Testable Success Criteria?
- ✅ Each criterion is measurable (numbers, formats, behaviors)
- ✅ Can write automated tests from these criteria
- ❌ Avoid: Subjective terms like "works well", "looks nice", "is fast"

**Self-Check**: Could I write a pytest test that verifies this criterion passes or fails?

#### 3. Explicit Constraints?
- ✅ Technology choices are justified (team expertise, environment limits)
- ✅ Edge cases are handled (errors, missing data, invalid inputs)
- ✅ Non-negotiables are stated clearly
- ❌ Avoid: Assuming "obvious" behavior (always make it explicit)

**Self-Check**: Are there any "what if...?" questions left unanswered?

#### 4. Prevents Scope Creep?
- ✅ Non-goals section explicitly defers features
- ✅ MVP scope is clear
- ❌ Avoid: Feature lists without priorities

**Self-Check**: If someone asks "What about [feature X]?", can I point to Non-Goals and say "v2"?

#### 5. No Ambiguity?
- ✅ Technical terms are defined or industry-standard
- ✅ Examples illustrate expected behavior
- ❌ Avoid: Terms like "handle properly", "as needed", "reasonable"

**Self-Check**: Could two developers implement this independently and produce identical behavior?

### Common Specification Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Vague Language**

❌ "System should handle errors gracefully"
✅ "System catches FileNotFoundError and returns default_settings dict"

**Pitfall 2: Missing Edge Cases**

❌ "Function divides two numbers"
✅ "Function divides two numbers; raises ZeroDivisionError if divisor is 0"

**Pitfall 3: Over-Specification (Premature Optimization)**

❌ "Use quicksort algorithm for sorting (O(n log n) average case)"
✅ "Sort user list by name (alphabetical order)"

**Why**: Intent is "sort by name". Algorithm choice (quicksort vs mergesort vs Python's Timsort) is implementation detail.

**Pitfall 4: Conflating Spec with Implementation**

❌ "Use for loop to iterate through config keys and write each to file"
✅ "Save config dict to JSON file"

**Why**: Spec defines **what** (save to JSON), not **how** (loop implementation).

**Pitfall 5: Forgetting Why**

❌ "Password reset tokens expire after 30 minutes"
✅ "Password reset tokens expire after 30 minutes (security: prevents token reuse if email compromised)"

**Why**: Rationale helps future developers understand tradeoffs.

---

### Quality Integration Example: CSV Exporter

Let's apply quality thinking to the CSV exporter from the practice exercise:

**❌ Vague Version**:
```
Export data to CSV file
```

**✅ Quality Version**:
```
## Intent
Applications need to export Python list-of-dicts to CSV format for
non-technical users to open in Excel/Google Sheets.

## Success Criteria
- export_to_csv(data: list[dict], filename: str) writes valid CSV file
- CSV opens in Excel without errors
- Column headers match dict keys from first row
- Special characters (commas, quotes) are escaped per RFC 4180
- Empty data list produces valid CSV with headers only

## Constraints
- Must use Python's built-in csv module (no pandas—too heavy)
- File encoding: UTF-8 (international character support)
- Must handle empty lists gracefully (no crashes)

## Non-Goals
- Custom delimiters (comma-only for MVP)
- Excel .xlsx format (CSV only)
- Data validation (caller's responsibility)
```

**Quality improvements made**:
1. Intent explains **why** (for non-technical users)
2. Success criteria are **testable** (can verify CSV opens in Excel)
3. Constraints are **justified** (no pandas—too heavy)
4. Edge cases addressed (empty lists, special characters)
5. Non-goals prevent scope creep (no xlsx, no validation)

## Memory Banks vs Specs: Understanding the Distinction

Before diving deeper into specs, it's crucial to understand an important distinction: **specs are not the same as memory banks**.

### Memory Banks (Constitutions / Steering)

**Memory banks** are persistent knowledge that applies across ALL AI coding sessions in your codebase:

- Rules files and coding standards
- High-level product vision and descriptions
- Architecture patterns and principles
- Technology stack decisions
- Security and compliance requirements

Think of memory banks as **permanent organizational knowledge** - the foundation that every feature must respect.

**Examples**:

- "All passwords must use bcrypt with cost factor 12+"
- "All API endpoints require authentication via JWT"
- "Test coverage must exceed 80%"
- "We use FastAPI for backends, React for frontends"

### Specs (Specifications)

**Specs** are ephemeral or semi-permanent artifacts tied to **specific features or changes**:

- Functional requirements for a particular feature
- Acceptance criteria for a user story
- Test scenarios for specific functionality
- Implementation details for one component

Think of specs as **temporary blueprints** - relevant only to the tasks that create or change that particular functionality.

**Examples**:

- "Password reset system: 30-minute token expiry, rate limiting, email-only recovery"
- "User profile page: display name, avatar, bio, edit functionality"
- "Payment checkout: support credit cards via Stripe, handle declined cards"

### The Key Difference

| Aspect         | Memory Bank                           | Spec                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Scope**      | Entire codebase                       | Specific feature/change         |
| **Lifetime**   | Permanent (or long-lived)             | Temporary or feature-lifetime   |
| **Applies to** | ALL development work                  | Only this feature's tasks       |
| **Changes**    | Rarely (represents stable principles) | Frequently (as feature evolves) |
| **Example**    | "Use bcrypt always"                   | "Password reset: 30-min expiry" |

**Why this matters**: When an AI agent works on your code, it should:

1. **Always reference** the memory bank (permanent rules)
2. **Only reference** the relevant spec (feature-specific details)

This distinction prevents confusion and ensures AI agents apply the right level of context to their work.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, memory banks are your organization's immune system—they prevent bad patterns from recurring. Specs are your surgical instruments—they solve specific problems precisely. Confusing the two is like using a scalpel when you need a vaccine, or vice versa.

## Practice: Write Your First Spec

Now it's your turn. You're going to write a specification for a simple Python feature: **exporting data from a Python list to a CSV file.**

This is **manual work** — no AI, no templates, just you and clarity of thought.

### Your Assignment

Create a spec.md file with these sections:

**1. Intent** (1-2 sentences)
- What problem does this solve?
- Why is it important?

**2. Success Criteria** (4-5 bullets)
- Each should be testable
- Think: "How will I know this works?"

**3. Constraints** (2-3 bullets)
- What must always be true?
- What limits our implementation?

**4. Non-Goals** (1-2 bullets)
- What's intentionally NOT included?
- What can wait for v2?

### Example Structure (for reference)

```markdown
# Specification: CSV Data Exporter

## Intent

Applications need to export Python data structures (list of dicts) to CSV files for sharing with non-technical users or importing into spreadsheet applications.
This improves usability by allowing data to be opened in Excel, Google Sheets, or other tools.

## Success Criteria

- Function export_to_csv(data: list, filename: str) writes data to valid CSV file
- CSV file can be opened in Excel/Google Sheets without errors
- Column headers match dict keys from first row
- Function handles special characters (commas, quotes) correctly
- Function preserves data types in output (numbers as numbers, not quoted strings)

## Constraints

- Must use only Python's built-in csv module (no external libraries)
- File encoding must be UTF-8 (supports international characters)
- CSV format must follow RFC 4180 standard (proper escaping, line endings)
- Must handle empty data lists gracefully (create valid empty CSV with headers)

## Non-Goals

- Custom delimiter support (comma-only for MVP)
- Excel .xlsx format (CSV only)
- Column sorting/reordering (use dict order)
- Data validation before export (caller validates data)
```

### Self-Validation Checklist

After you write your spec, validate against the **Quality Checklist for Specifications** from the Quality Awareness section above:

**Use These 5 Quality Questions:**
1. ✅ **Clear Intent?** (Section: Quality Awareness → Quality Checklist #1) — Can someone unfamiliar with the project understand the purpose in 30 seconds?
2. ✅ **Testable Success Criteria?** (Section: Quality Awareness → Quality Checklist #2) — Could you write a pytest test that verifies each criterion?
3. ✅ **Explicit Constraints?** (Section: Quality Awareness → Quality Checklist #3) — Are all edge cases and "what if...?" questions answered?
4. ✅ **Prevents Scope Creep?** (Section: Quality Awareness → Quality Checklist #4) — Can you point to Non-Goals and defer future features?
5. ✅ **No Ambiguity?** (Section: Quality Awareness → Quality Checklist #5) — Could two developers implement this independently with identical behavior?

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
Reference the pitfalls from Quality Awareness section:
- ❌ Vague language ("save properly" → "save to JSON with UTF-8 encoding")
- ❌ Missing edge cases ("export data" → "handle empty lists, special characters")
- ❌ Over-specification (don't specify algorithm, specify intent)
- ❌ Conflating spec with implementation (WHAT, not HOW)
- ❌ Forgetting why (include rationale for constraints)

**Validation Protocol**: For each criterion that's vague or missing, rewrite using the good spec vs bad spec examples from the **Good Specs vs Bad Specs Comparison** section (Quality Awareness → Part 3).

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

**Exercise 1 (10-15 minutes)**: Write your spec for CSV exporter using the structure above.

**Exercise 2 (5 minutes)**: Review your spec against the Self-Validation Checklist above. Rewrite any sections that are vague or unclear.

**Exercise 3 (Reflection)**: Compare your spec to the configuration file manager example earlier. What did you do well? What could be clearer?

**Exercise 4 (Quality Checklist Validation)**: Use the **5 Quality Questions** from the Self-Validation Checklist to validate your CSV exporter spec:
   - Does it answer "Clear Intent?" clearly and concisely?
   - Are all Success Criteria testable (could you write pytest tests)?
   - Are Constraints explicit with edge cases covered (empty lists, special characters)?
   - Does Non-Goals section prevent scope creep?
   - Is there any ambiguity? Could another developer implement identically?

   For each criterion that fails, rewrite using the **Good Specs vs Bad Specs** patterns from Quality Awareness section.

## Try With AI

Now that you've written your own spec manually, you're ready to explore how AI can help refine specifications. In Lesson 3, you'll see AI as a collaborative partner for spec improvement. But first, test your understanding with these prompts:

**🔍 Evaluate a Vague Spec:**
> "Here's a feature request: 'Make the app faster.' Rewrite this as a complete specification with Intent, Success Criteria, Constraints, and Non-Goals. What questions did I need to answer to make this specific?"

**🎯 Distinguish Specs from Memory Banks:**
> "I'm building a payment system. Is each of these a spec or memory bank rule? (1) 'All passwords must use bcrypt' (2) 'Payment checkout should support credit cards and PayPal' (3) 'API endpoints require JWT authentication' (4) 'Add a refund feature for disputed transactions.' Explain your reasoning."

**🧪 Test Your Spec Quality:**
> "Review this spec I wrote: [paste your CSV exporter spec from the practice exercise]. Is there any ambiguity? What success criteria could be more specific? What constraints am I missing?"

**🚀 Apply Evals-First to Your Work:**
> "I'm working on [describe a feature you need to build]. Help me write the Success Criteria section first, before I think about implementation. What would make this feature clearly 'done'?"
