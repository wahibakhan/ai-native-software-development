# Compiling MCP to Skills

You've learned MCP servers connect Claude Code to external systems. You've mastered skills as encoded expertise. Now: what happens when you want both, but MCP's token consumption makes it expensive?

![skills-mcp](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-2/chapter-05/skills-mcp.png)

This lesson shows you a powerful pattern: **compile high-token MCP servers into lean skills**, reducing context consumption by up to 98.7% while maintaining full functionality.

:::tip Industry Standard
Skills format is now supported by Claude Code, OpenAI Codex (beta), and Goose.
Skills you compile here work across all three agents.

## The Problem: MCP Token Bloat

When Claude Code loads an MCP server, it eagerly loads ALL tool definitions upfront. Here's the real impact from Anthropic's engineering blog:

> "Tool descriptions occupy more context window space, increasing response time and costs. For agents with thousands of tools, this means processing hundreds of thousands of tokens before reading a request."
> — Anthropic, [Code Execution with MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp)

**Concrete examples from the blog:**

- **Agent with 1,000 tools**: **150,000 tokens** loaded before your first request
- **2-hour meeting workflow**: Fetching transcript from Google Drive and attaching to Salesforce = **50,000 additional tokens** for repeated data processing
- **Compiled skill approach**: Reduces to **~2,000 tokens (98.7% reduction)**

**The math for a single MCP server**: Playwright MCP loads approximately 5,000-8,000 tokens of tool definitions. Use it 3 times in a session? That's 15,000-24,000 tokens of overhead—before you've accomplished anything.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "I have 3 MCP servers installed. Help me estimate my token overhead: For each server, how many tokens does it load at startup? What's my total context cost before I've even asked a question?"

---

## The Solution: Code Execution Pattern

Instead of calling MCP tools directly through Claude's context, compile them into **skills with executable scripts**:

### The Architecture

**SKILL.md + Scripts Model:**

```
.claude/skills/browsing-with-playwright/
├── SKILL.md                    # High-level procedures (~150 tokens)
├── references/                 # Cached tool documentation
└── scripts/
    ├── mcp-client.py          # Universal MCP client (HTTP/stdio transport)
    ├── start-server.sh        # Starts Playwright MCP on localhost:8808
    └── stop-server.sh         # Stops server gracefully
```

**How It Works:**

1. **SKILL.md** provides high-level procedures (loaded once at startup, ~150 tokens)
2. **Claude executes bash commands** calling `mcp-client.py` (runs locally, outside context)
3. **mcp-client.py** connects to Playwright MCP server via HTTP transport
4. **Server performs browser operations** (navigate, extract, screenshot)
5. **Only filtered results** returned to Claude's conversation

**Token Comparison:**

- Direct MCP: ~5,000-8,000 tokens × 3 calls = ~15,000-24,000 tokens
- Compiled skill: ~150 tokens (SKILL.md) + 0 tokens (local scripts) = ~150 tokens
- **Savings: ~98-99%**

---

### Progressive Disclosure: 3-Stage Loading

Skills use **three-level loading** (covered in Lesson 6) to minimize token consumption:

1. **Discovery** (startup): Load only `description` field (~30 tokens)
2. **Activation** (when relevant): Load full SKILL.md (~150 tokens)
3. **Execution** (when needed): Run `scripts/` locally (0 tokens in context)

**Key for compiled skills:** Stage 3 executes MCP tools outside Claude's context, so heavy operations consume zero tokens.

**Example:**

```
User: "Extract product prices from Amazon"

→ Stage 1: Match description "browser automation"
→ Stage 2: Load SKILL.md procedures
→ Stage 3: Execute script locally (filter 1000 → 20 products)
→ Return only 20 results to Claude
```

---

### Why Scripts Save Tokens

**Without scripts (direct MCP):**

```
User request → Claude calls browser_navigate (2,000 tokens loaded)
            → Claude calls browser_evaluate (3,000 tokens loaded)
            → Returns 1,000 product objects (10,000 tokens in context)
            → Claude filters to 20 relevant (10,000 tokens wasted)
Total: 15,000 tokens
```

**With scripts (code execution):**

```
User request → Claude runs bash command (0 tokens - executes locally)
            → bash: python mcp-client.py call -t browser_navigate ...
            → bash: python mcp-client.py call -t browser_evaluate ...
            → Server filters/processes data locally
            → Returns only final result to Claude (~200 tokens)
Total: ~200 tokens
```

**Savings: ~98-99%**

## Hands-On: Use browsing-with-playwright Skill from Skills Lab

You'll experience the power of compiled skills by using the pre-built **browsing-with-playwright skill** from Skills Lab, then comparing its token efficiency against direct MCP usage.

### Step 1: Download Skills Lab

If you haven't already downloaded Skills Lab from Lesson 4, do so now:

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

**If you already downloaded Skills Lab in Lesson 4**, navigate to that folder.

### Step 2: Baseline - Try Playwright MCP Directly

First, let's see the token overhead WITHOUT compilation. If you have Playwright MCP configured in Claude Code, start Claude:

```bash
claude
```

Ask Claude to use Playwright MCP directly:

```
Use the Playwright MCP server to navigate to https://example.com
and extract the main heading text.
```

**What happens:**

- Claude loads ALL Playwright MCP tool definitions (~5,000-8,000 tokens)
- Calls `browser_navigate` tool through context
- Calls `browser_evaluate` or `browser_snapshot` through context
- Full tool schemas processed for each call
- Returns result

**Observe**: This works, but notice the initial loading overhead when Claude loads tool definitions.

### Step 3: Now Use browsing-with-playwright Skill

Exit Claude (Ctrl+C) and restart for a fresh session in the Skills Lab folder:

```bash
claude
```

Now ask using the compiled skill:

```
Use browsing-with-playwright skill to navigate to https://example.com
and extract the main heading text.
```

**What happens:**

```
⏺ Skill(browsing-with-playwright)
  ⎿  Loading…

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Use skill "browsing-with-playwright"?
 Claude may use instructions, code, or files from this Skill.

   Browser automation using Playwright MCP. Navigate websites, fill forms,
   click elements, take screenshots, and extract data.

 Do you want to proceed?
 ❯ 1. Yes
  2. Yes, and don't ask again for browsing-with-playwright in this directory
  3. No
```

Select **1. Yes**.

**What happens now:**

1. Claude loads browsing-with-playwright SKILL.md (~150 tokens only)
2. Skill tells Claude to run: `bash scripts/start-server.sh` (starts Playwright MCP on localhost:8808)
3. Claude executes bash commands:
   ```bash
   python mcp-client.py call -u http://localhost:8808 -t browser_navigate \
     -p '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
   ```
4. **Script runs OUTSIDE Claude's context** (0 tokens consumed)
5. Only the result comes back: page snapshot showing heading "Example Domain"
6. Claude runs another command to extract heading:
   ```bash
   python mcp-client.py call -u http://localhost:8808 -t browser_evaluate \
     -p '{"function": "() => document.querySelector('h1').textContent"}'
   ```
7. Result returned: `"Example Domain"` (~100 tokens)
8. Claude stops server: `bash scripts/stop-server.sh`

**Key Difference**: Tool definitions NEVER loaded into Claude's context. All browser operations happen locally via HTTP calls.

### Step 4: Compare Token Usage

Ask Claude:

```
Compare the token usage between:
1. Using Playwright MCP directly (what we did in Step 2)
2. Using browsing-with-playwright skill (what we just did in Step 3)

Estimate the tokens consumed in each approach and
show me the percentage reduction.
```

**Expected explanation:**

```
Direct Playwright MCP:
- Tool definitions loaded at startup: ~5,000-8,000 tokens
- browser_navigate call in context: ~2,000 tokens
- browser_evaluate call in context: ~2,000 tokens
- Result processing: ~500 tokens
- Total: ~9,500-12,500 tokens

browsing-with-playwright skill:
- SKILL.md loaded: ~150 tokens
- Bash commands executed: 0 tokens (runs locally)
- Only final results returned: ~100 tokens
- Total: ~250 tokens

Reduction: ~97-98% token savings
```

### Step 5: Test Different Browser Operations

Try various automation tasks to see the skill in action:

```
1. Use browsing-with-playwright to take a screenshot of https://github.com and save it
2. Use browsing-with-playwright to extract the page title from https://news.ycombinator.com
3. Use browsing-with-playwright to check if example.com contains the text "documentation"
```

**Observe:**

- Each operation runs bash commands locally
- You see: `python mcp-client.py call -t <tool_name> ...`
- Server starts once, handles multiple operations
- Only filtered results come back to conversation
- Claude doesn't reload tool definitions

### Step 6: Explore How browsing-with-playwright Works Internally

After trying the skill, explore its structure:

```bash
# Look at the skill structure
ls -la .claude/skills/browsing-with-playwright/
```

You'll see:

```
SKILL.md           # Procedures Claude follows (~150 tokens)
references/        # Cached tool documentation
scripts/           # Scripts Claude executes locally
```

**This is the code execution pattern**: Heavy operations happen in local HTTP server, outside Claude's token-counted context.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "I've used browsing-with-playwright skill. Explain: (1) How does running mcp-client.py via bash save tokens vs calling MCP tools through Claude's context? (2) What happens when Claude executes 'python mcp-client.py call -t browser_navigate'? (3) If I performed 10 browser operations, what would be the token difference between direct MCP vs browsing-with-playwright skill?"

## Hands-On 2: Use fetch-library-docs Skill

Let's try a second compiled skill that demonstrates a different use case: **fetching library documentation with intelligent filtering**. This skill wraps the Context7 MCP server and reduces tokens by 60-90% through content-type filtering.

:::note No Programming Required
You don't need to understand the code in the documentation—you're learning how **token reduction** works, not React or Next.js. Focus on the numbers: how many tokens before vs after.
:::

### What fetch-library-docs Does

When developers need documentation, they typically ask questions like:
- "How do I install Next.js?"
- "Show me examples of useState"
- "What's the API for fetch in JavaScript?"

**Without the skill**: Context7 MCP returns everything—examples, explanations, API references, troubleshooting—consuming thousands of tokens.

**With the skill**: You specify what you need (`setup`, `examples`, `api-ref`), and the skill filters locally, returning only relevant content.

### Step 1: Try fetch-library-docs Skill

In your Skills Lab folder, start Claude:

```bash
claude
```

Ask Claude to fetch installation instructions:

```
Use fetch-library-docs skill to look up "getting started" for Next.js.
I only need setup instructions, not code examples.
```

**What happens:**

1. Claude loads fetch-library-docs SKILL.md (~150 tokens)
2. Skill executes bash command locally:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/fetch-docs.sh --library nextjs --topic "getting started" --content-type setup
   ```
3. Script calls Context7 MCP via subprocess (outside Claude's context)
4. **Filters response locally** to extract only terminal commands and setup instructions
5. Returns filtered content (~50-100 tokens instead of ~500-800)

**You'll see output like:**

```
## Setup Instructions

### Installation
npm create next-app@latest my-app

### Run Development Server
cd my-app
npm run dev

[Token savings: 81%]
```

### Step 2: Compare Content Types

Now try the same library but requesting code examples:

```
Use fetch-library-docs skill to look up "data fetching" for Next.js.
I want code examples only.
```

**Different content type = different filtering:**

```bash
bash scripts/fetch-docs.sh --library-id /vercel/next.js --topic "data fetching" --content-type examples
```

**You'll see:**

```
## Code Examples

### Example 1
export default async function Page() {
  let data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')
  let posts = await data.json()
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

[Token savings: 92%]
```

### Step 3: Understand the Token Savings

Ask Claude to explain what just happened:

```
Compare the token usage between:
1. Calling Context7 MCP directly for "Next.js data fetching"
2. Using fetch-library-docs skill with --content-type examples

Show me the savings breakdown.
```

### Step 4: Explore the Skill Structure

Ask Claude to show you the internal structure of fetch-library-docs skill:

You'll see:

```
SKILL.md           # Decision logic for when/how to fetch docs
references/        # Library IDs, patterns, API details
scripts/           # Shell scripts that call Context7 MCP locally
  ├── fetch-docs.sh      # Main orchestrator
  ├── fetch-raw.sh       # Calls Context7 MCP
  ├── filter-by-type.sh  # Routes to content extractors
  └── extract-*.sh       # Content-type specific filters
```

**Key insight**: The filtering happens in shell scripts (local execution), not in Claude's context. This is why tokens are saved—heavy processing stays outside the conversation.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "I used fetch-library-docs skill with two different content types: setup and examples. Explain: (1) Why does 'setup' have higher token savings than 'examples'? (2) What happens locally when the skill filters content? (3) If I needed both examples AND API reference, how would I request that?"

## When to Compile MCP Servers

Not every MCP server benefits from compilation. Use this decision framework:

### Compile to Skill When:

✅ **High token overhead** (>5,000 tokens per query)

- Example: Playwright, Google Drive, Database MCP, Context7 (documentation)

✅ **Frequent use** (3+ times per session or across projects)

- Repeated calls multiply token waste

✅ **Large datasets returned** (need filtering/transformation)

- Processing 1,000 items → returning 20 relevant ones

✅ **Multi-step workflows** (chaining operations)

- Navigate → extract → transform → filter

### Use Direct MCP When:

❌ **Low token overhead** (&lt;1,500 tokens per query)

- MCP already efficient, compilation overhead not worth it

❌ **Infrequent use** (once per month or less)

- Setup cost > token savings

❌ **Small, well-formatted results** (no transformation needed)

- Results already optimal for Claude

❌ **Rapidly changing API** (MCP tools frequently updated)

- Skill scripts would need constant maintenance

---

## Decision Framework: When to Compile vs. Use Direct MCP

Not every MCP server needs compilation. Use this matrix to decide:

| Scenario                                   | Recommendation   | Reasoning                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **One-off query**                          | Use MCP directly | Compilation overhead not worth it for single use |
| **Repeated workflow** (3+ times)           | Compile to skill | Amortizes compilation cost across multiple uses  |
| **High token definitions** (5,000+ tokens) | Compile to skill | Token savings justify upfront work               |
| **Low token definitions** (&lt;500 tokens) | Use MCP directly | Compilation provides minimal benefit             |
| **Rapidly changing API**                   | Use MCP directly | Compiled skill becomes stale quickly             |
| **Stable tool set**                        | Compile to skill | Skill remains accurate over time                 |
| **Privacy-sensitive data**                 | Compile to skill | Local script execution avoids context logging    |
| **Integration with other skills**          | Compile to skill | Composability improves with skill format         |
| **Team workflow**                          | Compile to skill | Shareable SKILL.md vs proprietary MCP setup      |

**Decision shortcut**:

- Calling MCP 1-2 times? → Use direct MCP
- Calling MCP 3+ times in same session? → Compile to skill
- Working with high-token server? → Compile to skill
- Building production workflow? → Compile to skill

---

## What's Ahead

You've experienced compiled skills and their massive token reduction—up to 98% savings while preserving full functionality. You understand the code execution pattern and why it works. But what happens when you need multiple skills working together on complex tasks?

**Lesson 10: Subagents and Orchestration** introduces the next level: specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of work with isolated context. Where compiled skills give you _efficiency_, subagents give you _coordination_—a team of focused specialists instead of one overloaded generalist.

**In advanced lessons**, you'll learn to create your own compiled skills using skill-creator, compiling other MCP servers (Google Drive, Database, etc.) and designing custom workflows. The skills you use from Skills Lab now become templates for creating your own later.
