## 🔀 Two Professional Paths Available

This lesson covers the **official Claude subscription setup** (Pro $20/month or Max $200/month). If you prefer a **free/minimal cost alternative**, see **Lesson 3: Free Claude Code Setup with Google Gemini**.

**Both paths teach identical Claude Code skills** (subagents, skills, MCP, hooks covered in Lessons 04-12).

| Path | Cost | What You Get |
|------|------|--------------|
| **This Lesson (Official)** | Pro: $20/month<br/>Max: $200/month | Official Anthropic models (Claude Sonnet/Opus), direct integration, official support |
| **Lesson 3 (Free/Minimal)** | $0 (free tier)<br/>Pay-as-you-go option | Use Claude Code agent with **any LLM** (Gemini, GPT, local models), backend abstraction architecture |

**Key difference**: Official path uses Anthropic's Claude models. Free path lets you use Claude Code's agentic architecture with any LLM backend through production-grade API routing.

## Installation

Claude Code installation has been simplified with official installers for each platform. Choose your operating system tab below to see platform-specific installation methods.

::::os-tabs

::windows
**⚠️ Important**: Claude Code requires a bash-compatible shell to run. On Windows, you need **either WSL or Git for Windows** installed—the installer downloads Claude Code, but it runs inside a bash shell.

**Decision Tree**:
```
Which shell environment do you have (or want to install)?
├─ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
│   └─ Method 1 (WSL) - RECOMMENDED for best experience
│
├─ Git for Windows (Git Bash)
│   └─ Method 2 (Git Bash + PowerShell installer)
│
├─ Neither installed yet
│   └─ Install WSL first (see below), then use Method 1
│
└─ I have Node.js 18+ in WSL or Git Bash
    └─ Method 3 (npm) - See Cross-Platform npm section below
```

#### Method 1: WSL (RECOMMENDED)

**Why recommended**: Full Linux environment, best compatibility, recommended by Anthropic.

**Step 1**: If you don't have WSL, install it first (run in PowerShell as Administrator):

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Restart your computer after installation.

**Step 2**: Open your WSL terminal (Ubuntu) and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**What this does**: Downloads and executes the official installer script in your Linux environment.

**Requirements**: Windows 10 version 2004+ or Windows 11, WSL 1 or WSL 2

#### Method 2: Native Windows (PowerShell or CMD)

**When to use**: You want to run Claude Code natively on Windows without WSL.

**Option A - PowerShell**:

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Option B - Command Prompt (CMD)**:

```cmd
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

**Requirements**: Windows 10+, Git for Windows (provides the bash shell Claude Code needs)

**Step 1**: Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) if not already installed.

**Step 2**: Run one of the install commands above.

**Step 3**: For portable Git installations, configure the bash path (run in PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH="C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

To make this permanent, add to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
# Add the line: $env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH="C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

**Step 4**: Run Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

**What this does**: The installer downloads Claude Code; Git for Windows provides the bash shell it runs in.

:::

#### Windows Verification

Open your shell (WSL terminal or Git Bash) and check your installation:

```bash
claude --version
```

**Expected output**:
```
X.X.XX (Claude Code)
```

(Your version number will differ—Claude Code auto-updates frequently.)

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Explain the difference between WSL and Git Bash for Windows developers. When would you choose one over the other for AI-native development workflows?"

::macos
**Decision Tree**:
```
Which installation method do you prefer?
├─ Native install (simplest)
│   └─ Method 1 (curl/bash) - RECOMMENDED
│
├─ I prefer Homebrew for package management
│   └─ Method 2 (Homebrew)
│
└─ I have Node.js 18+
    └─ Method 3 (npm) - See Cross-Platform npm section below
```

#### Method 1: Native Install (RECOMMENDED)

**Why recommended**: Official installer, works out of the box, no dependencies required.

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**What this does**: Downloads and executes the official installer script.

**Requirements**: curl and bash (pre-installed on macOS)

#### Method 2: Homebrew

**When to use**: You prefer managing packages through Homebrew for centralized updates.

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

**What this does**: Installs Claude Code using Homebrew's cask system (for GUI/binary applications). Installs to `/Applications`.

**Requirements**: Homebrew installed

**Don't have Homebrew?** Install it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### macOS Verification

Check your installation:

```bash
claude --version
```

**Expected output**:
```
X.X.XX (Claude Code)
```

(Your version number will differ—Claude Code auto-updates frequently.)

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> Claude Code auto-updates itself, so you get the latest features without manual intervention. If you use Homebrew for other tools, `brew install --cask claude-code` integrates Claude Code into your existing workflow—but the native installer works equally well.

::linux
**Decision Tree**:
```
Are you on Ubuntu/Debian/WSL?
├─ Yes → Method 1 (curl/bash) - RECOMMENDED
│
├─ I'm on Alpine Linux
│   └─ See Alpine Linux Special Configuration below
│
└─ I have Node.js 18+
    └─ Method 2 (npm) - See Cross-Platform npm section below
```

#### Method 1: curl/bash (RECOMMENDED)

**Why recommended**: Universal, minimal dependencies, works on all major distributions.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**What this does**: Downloads and executes the official installer script, automatically detecting your distribution.

**Requirements**:
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 10+
- curl and bash (pre-installed on most distributions)

**Supported Distributions**:
- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04
- Debian 10, 11, 12
- WSL 2 (with Ubuntu or Debian)

#### Alpine Linux Special Configuration

Alpine Linux requires additional C++ runtime libraries:

```bash
apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep
export USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0
```

**What this does**:
1. Installs required libraries (libgcc, libstdc++) and ripgrep
2. Configures Claude Code to use system ripgrep instead of built-in version

**Make it permanent**: Add `export USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0` to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).

#### Linux/WSL Verification

Check your installation:

```bash
claude --version
```

**Expected output**:
```
X.X.XX (Claude Code)
```

(Your version number will differ—Claude Code auto-updates frequently.)

### Cross-Platform: npm Installation

**When to use this method**:
- You already have Node.js 18+ installed
- You prefer npm-based workflows
- You need to manage Claude Code versions via package.json
- Your platform isn't officially supported by platform-specific installers

**Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**What this does**: Installs Claude Code globally via npm package manager.

**Requirements**: Node.js 18 or later (includes npm)

**Check Node.js version**:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see `v18.0.0` or higher, you're good to go.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Explain the trade-offs between platform-specific installers (Homebrew, PowerShell) vs npm. When would a developer choose npm over the platform installer?"

---

### Auto-Update Configuration

Claude Code automatically checks for updates and prompts you to install them. To disable auto-updates (useful for corporate environments or version pinning):

**macOS/Linux/WSL**:

```bash
export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1
```

Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make permanent.

**Windows PowerShell**:

```powershell
$env:DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1
```

Add to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`) to make permanent.

**Manual update check**:

```bash
claude update
```

---

### Advanced: System Diagnostics

After installation, verify your system configuration:

```bash
claude doctor
```

**What this checks**:
- Installation integrity
- Authentication status
- System compatibility
- Network connectivity to Claude API

Use this command if you encounter issues during installation or authentication.

## Authentication: Connecting Claude Code to Your Account

Once installed, Claude Code needs to authenticate with your Claude account. There are **three authentication paths** depending on your account type and use case.

### Which Authentication Method Should I Use?

**Decision Tree**:

```
What type of Claude access do you have?
├─ Claude.ai subscription (Pro, Max, Team)
│   └─ Method 1: Claude App Authentication (MOST COMMON)
│
├─ Claude Console account with API credits
│   └─ Method 2: Console API Authentication
│
└─ Enterprise account (Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry)
    └─ Method 3: Enterprise Authentication
```

**If you have both subscription and Console API**: Use Method 1 (Claude App)—it's simpler and provides unified access.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, authentication isn't just about access—it's about resource management. Claude.ai (subscription) vs Console API (pay-per-use) vs Enterprise (dedicated capacity) represents different cost models and usage patterns. Understanding your workflow determines which path saves money.

---

### Method 1: Claude App Authentication (Most Common)

**Who this is for**: Users with Claude Pro ($20/month), Claude Max ($200/month), or Team subscriptions.

**Benefits**: Unified access across Claude web app and Claude Code, simpler authentication flow.

In your terminal, run:

```bash
claude
```

**Expected output**:
```
 Claude Code can be used with your Claude subscription or billed based on API usage through your
 Console account.

 Select login method:

 ❯ 1. Claude account with subscription · Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise

   2. Anthropic Console account · API usage billing
```

Select Option 1. Your default browser opens to Claude.ai authentication. Log in, review permissions, and authorize.

Return to your terminal. You should see:

```
Logged in as mr.abc@gmail.com
Login successful. Press Enter to continue
```

Test your setup:

```bash
claude "Hello! Can you confirm Claude Code is working?"
```

**Expected output**: Claude responds confirming the connection works.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I just installed Claude Code. Create a simple 'Hello World' workflow that: (a) shows me Claude can read a file, (b) proposes a small change, (c) explains what it did. Use a safe test file."

**Expected Outcome**: Confidence that Claude Code can read, propose changes, and explain actions—plus understanding of the approval workflow.

---

### Method 2: Console API Authentication (Developers)

**Who this is for**: Developers with Claude Console API credits but no Claude.ai subscription. Pay-per-use model based on token consumption.

**Use case**: API-first workflows, programmatic access, usage-based billing.

In your terminal, run:

```bash
claude
```

**Expected output**:
```
 Claude Code can be used with your Claude subscription or billed based on API usage through your
 Console account.

 Select login method:

   1. Claude account with subscription · Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise

 ❯ 2. Anthropic Console account · API usage billing
```

Select Option 2. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys, create an API key, copy it, and paste when prompted.

You should see:

```
API key validated successfully
Login successful. Press Enter to continue
```

Test your setup:

```bash
claude "Hello! Can you confirm Claude Code is working?"
```

**Expected output**: Claude responds confirming the connection works.

**⚠️ Important for Console API Users**:
- Set usage limits in Console: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits
- Monitor token usage (displayed after each interaction)
- Console authentication uses API billing, not subscription credits
- Consider cost management strategies for high-volume usage

---

### Method 3: Enterprise Authentication (Advanced)

**Who this is for**: Enterprise customers using Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Anthropic Foundry (dedicated capacity).

**Use case**: Organizations with existing cloud infrastructure, compliance requirements, or dedicated capacity needs.

**Platform Options**:

#### Amazon Bedrock Integration

- Enterprise API keys

**Configuration**: Contact your Anthropic Enterprise support for Foundry setup.

**📚 Enterprise Documentation**: For detailed enterprise configuration, see https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/claude-on-amazon-bedrock or contact your Enterprise administrator.

---
## Security and Best Practices

Before moving forward, let's address important security considerations:

**1. File System Access**

- Claude Code can read and write files in directories where you run it
- **Best Practice**: Start Claude Code sessions in project directories, not system directories
- Review file changes Claude proposes before approving them

**2. Command Execution**

- Claude Code can execute terminal commands with your permissions
- **Best Practice**: Review commands Claude suggests, especially `sudo` or administrative commands
- Claude Code will ask for approval before executing destructive actions

**3. Cost Management (Console API Users)**

- Set usage limits in Claude Console: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits
- Monitor usage regularly to avoid unexpected bills
- Claude Code displays token usage after each interaction

---

## Try With AI

Now that Claude Code is installed, let's build confidence through safe exploration and establish good security practices.

**🛡️ Establish Safety Boundaries:**

> "I just installed Claude Code and I'm nervous about file access and command execution. Help me set up safe boundaries: What directories should I AVOID running Claude Code in? What commands should I NEVER approve without careful review? Create a practical safety checklist I can follow until I'm more comfortable."

**🎯 Practice First Commands:**

> "I completed installation successfully! Give me 3-5 safe 'Hello World' style prompts I can try RIGHT NOW that will: (a) verify Claude Code works, (b) won't modify important files, (c) demonstrate basic capabilities. Include what I should expect to see for each prompt."

**🧪 Test Your Installation:**

> "Walk me through testing my Claude Code installation step-by-step. Start with checking the version, then test file reading (on a safe test file), then test a simple command execution (like checking current directory). Explain what each output means and how to know if something's wrong."

**🚀 Configure for Your Workflow:**

> "I work primarily with [describe your tech stack: Python/JavaScript/Go/etc.]. Help me verify Claude Code can handle my environment: check for required tools, test reading my project structure, and suggest first productive task I could try that's relevant to my actual work."
