# Your Employee's Senses

:::info Silver Tier Lesson
This lesson begins the **Silver Tier**. Complete Bronze Tier (L01-L07) first.
:::

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you to build **Python Watcher scripts** that give your Personal AI Employee the ability to perceive changes in the world — transforming it from reactive (waits for you) to proactive (notices things itself).

**What You'll Build:**
- `BaseWatcher` abstract class (consistent pattern for all watchers)
- `GmailWatcher` that polls Gmail API for urgent messages
- `FileWatcher` that monitors a drop folder for new files

**Key Concept:** Watchers create `.md` files in `/Needs_Action/` that trigger Claude Code to reason and act.
