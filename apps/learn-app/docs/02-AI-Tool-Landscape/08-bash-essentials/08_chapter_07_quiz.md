  questions={[
    {
      question: "Your AI suggests running `rm -rf backup/` to delete old files. Following the safety-first pattern, what should happen BEFORE this command executes?",
      options: [
        "AI should explain the command, you verify the folder location and contents, then execute",
        "AI should immediately execute and show you the results afterward",
        "You should memorize what rm -rf does before asking AI",
        "AI should create a backup of the backup folder first"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The safety-first pattern requires verification BEFORE execution. AI should explain what rm -rf does (remove recursively and forcefully), show you the current directory with pwd, list the backup folder contents with ls, and wait for your confirmation. Only then should it execute. Option B (execute first) violates the safety pattern by acting before verification. Option C misunderstands AI-native development—you don't need to memorize commands; you need to understand what AI is doing. Option D addresses the wrong problem—backing up the backup doesn't help verify you're deleting the right folder. The correct approach is: Ask → Explain → Understand → Verify (check location and contents) → Execute. This prevents accidentally deleting the wrong folder or losing important files.

    },
    {
      question: "When your AI shows `pwd` output as `/Users/mjs/Documents/projects/my-app`, what does this path tell you about the AI's current context?",
      options: [
        "AI is in my-app folder within projects, which is inside Documents",
        "AI can only access files named my-app",
        "AI is confused and needs to navigate to a different location",
        "AI has created a new folder called my-app for you"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The pwd output shows AI's working directory as an absolute path. Reading from left to right, AI is in the my-app folder, which is inside projects, which is inside Documents, which is inside mjs's home directory under Users. This tells you exactly where AI is 'standing' in the file system—all subsequent relative path operations will be relative to this location. Option B is incorrect—pwd shows location, not file access restrictions. Option C misunderstands what pwd does—it's not showing an error, just reporting current location. Option D is wrong—pwd displays existing location; it doesn't create folders. Understanding AI's working directory is crucial because it affects which files AI can access with relative paths and prevents mistakes like operating on the wrong folder. Source: Lesson 1",

    },
    {
      question: "You ask your AI to 'organize Python files into a scripts folder.' The AI responds: 'I'll run mkdir scripts && mv *.py scripts/' but then reports it cannot execute commands directly. What does this reveal about AI collaboration?",
      options: [
        "AI can guide and explain commands, but you may need to execute them yourself",
        "The AI is broken and should be able to run all commands",
        "You should switch to a different AI tool immediately",
        "AI should never suggest commands it cannot execute on its own"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "This scenario (adapted from real Gemini CLI dialogue in Lesson 2) demonstrates that AI collaboration is not about AI doing everything automatically. Some AI tools guide you through commands rather than executing directly on your system. This is actually a safety feature—you maintain control over what runs on your machine. The AI explains WHAT to do and WHY, you verify it makes sense, then YOU execute the commands. Option B is incorrect—different AI tools have different execution capabilities; this doesn't mean they're broken. Option C is unnecessary—guidance is valuable even without direct execution. Option D misunderstands the collaboration model—AI suggesting commands you execute is a valid and often safer workflow. Real AI-native development involves AI as teacher/coworker, not just as an automated script runner. Source: Lesson 2",
      source: "Lesson 2: The Safety-First Dialogue Pattern"
    },
    {
      question: "Your AI runs `ls -la` and shows several items starting with 'd' and others starting with '-'. What critical information does this output provide before file operations?",
      options: [
        "Items with d are directories, items with dash are files, helping distinguish folder versus file operations",
        "The d indicates files that are ready to delete safely",
        "The dash means files are hidden and should not be accessed",
        "This output shows file permissions and should be ignored for navigation"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The first character in ls -la output distinguishes file types. 'd' indicates directories (folders), while '-' indicates regular files. This distinction is crucial BEFORE performing operations—copying a folder requires cp -r (recursive flag), while copying a file uses cp alone. Deleting a folder versus a file also requires different awareness. Option B is incorrect—'d' has nothing to do with deletion safety; it just marks directories. Option C is wrong—hidden files start with a dot in their name, not with a dash in the permissions field. Option D misunderstands the output—while the string does show permissions (rwxr-xr-x), the first character specifically identifies file type, which is essential for navigation and operations. Recognizing d versus - helps you supervise AI operations by knowing whether AI is operating on folders or files. Source: Lesson 1",
      source: "Lesson 1: Introducing Your AI Companion's Workspace"
    },
    {
      question: "According to the 5-step safety pattern, you're at Step 4 (Verify) before your AI moves files. Which question demonstrates the BEST safety verification?",
      options: [
        "Show me which specific files will be moved and what the destination folder currently contains",
        "Is this the fastest way to move these files?",
        "Why did you choose to use mv instead of cp for this task?",
        "What operating system are you running this command on?"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Step 4 (Verify) focuses on safety-critical questions that prevent data loss or mistakes. Asking AI to show WHICH files will be affected and WHAT already exists in the destination prevents overwriting important files or moving the wrong items. This is a concrete verification step with actionable output. Option B (fastest way) is about efficiency, not safety—it's a philosophical question that doesn't prevent mistakes. Option C (why mv instead of cp) is about understanding alternatives, which is useful but doesn't verify the CURRENT operation's safety. Option D (operating system) is tangential information that doesn't help you verify whether the right files are being moved to the right place. Good Step 4 questions focus on: What exactly will be affected? Can I undo this? Are there conflicts? Show me before you act. Source: Lesson 2",
      source: "Lesson 2: The Safety-First Dialogue Pattern"
    },
    {
      question: "Your AI is in `/Users/mjs/projects` and runs `cd app/src`. After this, what will `pwd` show, and why does this matter?",
      options: [
        "It will show /Users/mjs/projects/app/src because cd used a relative path from the current location",
        "It will show app/src because cd always shows just the folder you navigated to",
        "It will show /app/src because AI navigated to a new root folder",
        "It will show an error because you cannot use cd with two folder levels"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "When cd uses a relative path (no leading /), it navigates FROM the current directory. Starting from /Users/mjs/projects and running cd app/src moves into the app subfolder, then into src within app, resulting in /Users/mjs/projects/app/src. This full path will be shown by pwd. Understanding this matters because it shows how relative paths build on your current location. Option B is incorrect—pwd always shows the complete absolute path, not just the last folder name. Option C misunderstands relative vs absolute paths—app/src without a leading / is relative, not a new root path. Option D is wrong—cd accepts multi-level relative paths like app/src or even app/src/components. Knowing how relative paths resolve helps you track where AI is navigating and verify it's in the correct location before operations. Source: Lesson 3",
      source: "Lesson 3: Understanding File Navigation Through Dialogue"
    },
    {
      question: "You ask your AI to copy a folder called `data/` to `data-backup/`. The AI suggests `cp data data-backup`. What's wrong with this command, and what should happen instead?",
      options: [
        "The command needs cp -r for recursive folder copying; AI should explain the -r flag is required",
        "Nothing is wrong; cp works the same for files and folders without any difference",
        "AI should use mv instead of cp because folders cannot be copied at all",
        "The command needs cp data/ data-backup to include the trailing slashes for folders"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Copying folders requires the -r (recursive) flag because folders contain other items (files and subfolders) that must be copied too. cp data data-backup without -r will fail with an error like 'data is a directory (not copied).' The correct command is cp -r data data-backup. AI should explain that folders need special handling and use -r to copy everything inside recursively. Option B is incorrect—cp without flags only works for individual files, not directories. Option C is wrong—folders CAN be copied; you just need the right flag. mv would MOVE (not copy) the folder, which is different from creating a backup. Option D misunderstands bash syntax—trailing slashes are optional and don't affect whether cp works; the -r flag is what matters. Understanding when operations need flags (like -r for folders) helps you verify AI is using the right command structure. Source: Lesson 4",
      source: "Lesson 4: Understanding File Operations Safely"
    },
    {
      question: "Your project needs an API key. You're deciding between `export API_KEY='sk-123'` in terminal or storing it in a `.env` file. What's the critical difference that affects your choice?",
      options: [
        "Export is temporary and disappears when terminal closes; .env file persists across terminal sessions",
        "Export is more secure than .env files because it does not write to disk at all",
        "There is no difference; both approaches work identically in all situations",
        ".env files are only for production environments; export is for development work"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The export command sets an environment variable for the current terminal session only. When you close the terminal, the variable is gone. A .env file writes the configuration to disk, so it persists across terminal restarts and can be loaded by your application consistently. This makes .env files better for project-specific configuration that needs to be available every time you work on the project. Option B is incorrect—export and .env have similar security properties; both can be secure or insecure depending on how you protect them (.env needs .gitignore). Option C is wrong—persistence is a major difference that affects workflow. Option D misunderstands the use case—.env files are used in both development and production; the key is ensuring .env is in .gitignore so secrets don't reach version control. Understanding persistence helps you choose the right configuration approach for your workflow. Source: Lesson 5",
      source: "Lesson 5: Understanding Configuration and Secrets Safely"
    },
    {
      question: "You hardcoded `API_KEY = 'sk-abc123'` directly in your Python code and pushed it to GitHub. Your AI warns this is dangerous. What specific risk does this create?",
      options: [
        "Anyone with access to your GitHub repository can see and use your API key to access your account",
        "The API key will stop working immediately when it appears in code files",
        "Python cannot read API keys from code files and will throw syntax errors always",
        "GitHub will automatically delete your repository when it detects hardcoded secrets in any code"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "When you hardcode secrets in code and push to version control, anyone who can access your repository—including collaborators, future employers looking at your portfolio, or malicious actors if it's public—can see your API key. They can use it to access your account, rack up charges, or steal data. This is a critical security vulnerability. Option B is incorrect—API keys don't stop working just because they're in code; they continue to work (which is the problem—others can use them too). Option C is wrong—Python reads hardcoded strings just fine; the issue is security, not syntax. Option D overstates the consequence—GitHub may warn you about exposed secrets, but doesn't automatically delete repositories. The real risk is unauthorized access to your services. The solution is storing secrets in environment variables or .env files (with .env in .gitignore) and reading them with os.getenv(). Source: Lesson 5",
      source: "Lesson 5: Understanding Configuration and Secrets Safely"
    },
    {
      question: "Your AI runs `pip install requests` and shows that 5 packages were installed even though you only asked for 1. What does this reveal about package management?",
      options: [
        "Package managers automatically install dependencies, so requests needs 4 other packages to function properly and pip installs them all",
        "The AI made a mistake and installed extra packages you do not actually need for your project",
        "pip always installs 5 packages minimum regardless of what you request to ensure system stability works",
        "The extra 4 packages are backups in case requests fails to install correctly the first time"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "When you install a package, the package manager resolves its dependency tree. requests depends on certifi, charset-normalizer, idna, and urllib3. pip automatically installs all of these because requests won't work without them. This is called transitive dependency resolution—dependencies of dependencies are handled automatically. This saves you from manually tracking down and installing every required package. Option B is incorrect—pip is working correctly, not making a mistake. Dependencies are necessary, not extra. Option C is wrong—pip doesn't have a minimum package count; it installs exactly what's needed. If a package has no dependencies, pip installs just that one package. Option D misunderstands dependencies—they're not backups; they're required functional components. Understanding dependency resolution helps you recognize that installing packages is rarely a one-to-one operation and verify all dependencies installed successfully. Source: Lesson 6",
      source: "Lesson 6: Understanding Dependencies and Packages"
    },
    {
      question: "You're working on a Python project and need to install a JavaScript library. Your AI refuses and says it needs npm instead of pip. What does this reveal about package managers?",
      options: [
        "Different languages have different package managers; Python uses pip, JavaScript uses npm, and they manage different package ecosystems entirely",
        "The AI is malfunctioning because pip should be able to install any type of package regardless of language",
        "You can install JavaScript packages with pip by adding the --js flag to the install command",
        "npm and pip are the same tool with different names depending on operating system you are using"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Package managers are language-specific. pip accesses PyPI (Python Package Index) and installs Python packages. npm accesses the npm registry and installs JavaScript/Node.js packages. They manage completely different ecosystems and cannot install each other's packages. Python projects use pip; JavaScript projects use npm; macOS system tools use brew; Linux uses apt. Your AI recognizes your project context and uses the appropriate package manager. Option B is incorrect—pip only works with Python packages; it can't install JavaScript libraries. Option C is wrong—there is no --js flag for pip. Option D misunderstands package managers—npm and pip are different tools for different languages, not the same tool with different names. Understanding that package managers are language-specific helps you verify AI is using the right tool for your project type. Source: Lesson 6",
      source: "Lesson 6: Understanding Dependencies and Packages"
    },
    {
      question: "Your AI suggests the command `ls -la | grep '.py' | wc -l` to count Python files. Trace the data flow through this pipeline—what happens at each step?",
      options: [
        "ls lists all files, grep filters to lines containing .py, wc -l counts the filtered lines giving Python file count",
        "ls counts files, grep searches for Python, wc displays the results in a formatted table",
        "The pipe combines all three commands into one operation that runs simultaneously on all files at once",
        "ls finds Python files first, grep verifies they are valid, wc checks their size and reports total bytes"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Pipes connect commands sequentially, passing output from one as input to the next. ls -la produces a complete file listing (all files, all details). The pipe | sends this output to grep '.py', which filters to only lines containing '.py' (Python files). The second pipe sends those filtered lines to wc -l, which counts them. Result: the count of Python files. This is assembly-line data processing. Option B is incorrect—ls doesn't count, grep doesn't search file contents (it filters lines), and wc -l counts lines, not formatting output. Option C misunderstands pipes—commands run in sequence (output → filter → count), not simultaneously. Option D is wrong about what each command does—ls lists all files (not just Python), grep filters text (doesn't validate files), and wc -l counts lines (not sizes). Understanding data flow through pipes helps you predict output and verify AI's pipeline logic makes sense. Source: Lesson 7",
      source: "Lesson 7: Understanding Pipes and Complex Commands"
    },
    {
      question: "You ask your AI to find errors in a 10,000-line log file. It suggests `cat application.log | grep 'ERROR' | wc -l`. What would you modify to see the actual error messages instead of just counting them?",
      options: [
        "Remove the wc -l part to stop at grep, which will display all error lines instead of counting",
        "Add a --show flag to wc -l to display lines while counting them simultaneously",
        "Replace grep with cat to show all log lines including the errors mixed with other messages",
        "Change the pipe to && so all commands run independently showing different output each time"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The pipeline cat application.log | grep 'ERROR' | wc -l counts error lines. To see the actual error messages, stop the pipeline before wc -l. Running cat application.log | grep 'ERROR' (without the count step) will output all lines containing 'ERROR' to your terminal. The final command in a pipeline determines what you see—wc -l shows a count, grep shows matching lines. By removing wc -l, you change the output from a number to the actual error text. Option B is incorrect—wc -l doesn't have a --show flag; it only counts. Option C is wrong—replacing grep with cat would show ALL 10,000 lines, not just errors. Option D misunderstands operators— && runs commands sequentially based on success, not in a data flow pipeline. Understanding how to modify pipelines by adding/removing stages helps you adapt AI suggestions to get exactly the output you need. Source: Lesson 7",
      source: "Lesson 7: Understanding Pipes and Complex Commands"
    },
    {
      question: "The 5-step safety pattern includes Ask, Explain, Understand, Verify, Execute. Why is 'Verify' positioned BEFORE 'Execute' instead of checking results afterward?",
      options: [
        "Verification before execution prevents destructive mistakes that cannot be undone; checking after is too late for dangerous operations",
        "Verification after execution is more accurate because you can see what actually happened in real results",
        "The order does not matter since you can undo any operation in bash with the undo command",
        "Execute must come last in the sequence for grammatical reasons to make the acronym work properly"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Verify comes before Execute because some operations are destructive and irreversible. If AI runs rm -rf backup/ and deletes the wrong folder, checking afterward doesn't help—your files are gone. Verification means asking questions like 'Show me what's in that folder' and 'Are you sure this is the right location?' BEFORE deletion. This prevents mistakes. Option B misunderstands the purpose—verification isn't about accuracy of results; it's about preventing dangerous operations from running in the first place. Option C is incorrect—bash has no general undo command. Deleted files are very difficult to recover. Option D is irrelevant—the order is about safety, not acronyms. Real-world example: Verifying before a git push --force prevents overwriting team members' work. Verifying before rm -rf prevents data loss. The pattern prioritizes prevention over recovery because recovery is often impossible. Source: Lesson 2",

    },
    {
      question: "Your AI is in `/Users/mjs/projects` and you want it to navigate to your home directory `/Users/mjs`. What's the MOST RELIABLE command and why?",
      options: [
        "cd ~ because tilde is a shortcut to home directory that works regardless of current location",
        "cd .. because it always goes up one level to the parent directory which is home",
        "cd /Users/mjs because absolute paths are always longer and therefore more reliable than shortcuts",
        "cd home because home is a universal bash keyword that navigates to home from anywhere"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "cd ~ is most reliable because ~ is a bash shortcut that always refers to your home directory, regardless of where you currently are. From /Users/mjs/projects or /var/log or anywhere else, cd ~ always takes you home. This is an absolute navigation that doesn't depend on your current location. Option B is incorrect—cd .. goes up ONE level. From /Users/mjs/projects, that goes to /Users/mjs (which happens to be home in this case), but from /Users/mjs/projects/app/src, cd .. would only go to /Users/mjs/projects/app, not home. Option C is wrong—absolute paths aren't more reliable because they're longer; they're reliable because they specify a complete location. But you'd need to know your exact home path (/Users/mjs vs /home/mjs on Linux). ~ works everywhere. Option D is incorrect—'home' is not a bash keyword. Understanding shortcuts like ~ helps you navigate confidently without knowing absolute paths. Source: Lesson 3",

    },
    {
      question: "You run `cd ..` three times in a row from `/Users/mjs/projects/app/src`. Where do you end up, and what does this teach about relative navigation?",
      options: [
        "You end up at /Users/mjs because each cd .. moves up one level toward the root directory",
        "You end up back at /Users/mjs/projects/app/src because cd .. reverses the previous cd command",
        "You get an error because cd .. can only be used once per terminal session for safety",
        "You end up at / because cd .. always goes to the root directory when repeated"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Each cd .. moves up one level in the directory tree. Starting from /Users/mjs/projects/app/src: first cd .. → /Users/mjs/projects/app, second cd .. → /Users/mjs/projects, third cd .. → /Users/mjs. You move up toward the root directory with each execution. This demonstrates that relative navigation is cumulative—each command is relative to your new location after the previous command. Option B is incorrect—cd .. doesn't reverse or undo; it navigates up one level each time. Option C is wrong—there's no limit on using cd ..; you can run it as many times as needed. Option D misunderstands the behavior—cd .. moves up ONE level per execution, not all the way to root. To reach root (/) you'd need to cd .. many more times (or use cd /). Understanding cumulative relative navigation helps you track your location through multiple commands. Source: Lesson 3",

      question: "You want to delete a folder called `old-backup` but first need to verify it's the right one. Following the safety pattern, what dialogue sequence should occur?",
      options: [
        "AI shows pwd and ls to confirm location and folder contents, you verify it is the correct folder, then AI executes rm -rf after your confirmation",
        "AI immediately runs rm -rf old-backup and shows you the success message afterward for confirmation it worked correctly",
        "AI creates a backup of old-backup first, then deletes the original, then asks if you want to keep the backup created",
        "You manually memorize the folder contents before asking AI to delete so you can verify it deleted correctly"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The safety pattern for destructive operations requires: (1) AI shows current location with pwd, (2) AI lists old-backup contents with ls -la old-backup/, (3) You review what will be deleted, (4) You explicitly confirm, (5) AI executes rm -rf old-backup. This prevents deleting the wrong folder. Option B violates the safety pattern by executing before verification—if old-backup contains important files or AI is in the wrong directory, it's too late. Option C addresses the wrong problem—backing up something you intend to delete is contradictory. The issue isn't creating backups; it's verifying you're deleting the right thing. Option D misunderstands AI-native workflow—you don't need to memorize; AI shows you, and you verify visually before proceeding. The key is verification BEFORE execution for irreversible operations.

    {
      question: "Your AI suggests `mv project/ project-backup/` to rename a folder. Later you realize you wanted a COPY, not a move. What's the problem with mv, and what should you do differently?",
      options: [
        "mv relocates the original folder leaving nothing at the old location; you should use cp -r to create a copy instead",
        "mv is correct because renaming and copying are the same operation in bash with identical results for folders",
        "You can undo mv by running mv project-backup/ project/ which restores the original location with no data loss",
        "mv is safer than cp because it prevents having duplicate folders with the same name in different locations"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "mv (move) relocates the folder, changing its location or name. After mv project/ project-backup/, the folder exists ONLY as project-backup; there's no copy left at project/. If you wanted both folders, you needed cp -r project/ project-backup/, which copies the folder and all its contents while leaving the original in place. This is a critical distinction—mv is destructive to the original location. Option B is incorrect—renaming (mv) and copying (cp) are fundamentally different. mv leaves one copy; cp creates two. Option C is partially true—you can mv back, but this misses the point: if you wanted BOTH a backup AND the original, mv doesn't accomplish that. You'd have to mv back and start over with cp. Option D is irrelevant—safety isn't about preventing duplicates; it's about understanding what operation you actually need. Understanding mv vs cp prevents data organization mistakes.

    {
      question: "You created a `.env` file with secrets and pushed it to GitHub by mistake. Your AI suggests adding `.env` to `.gitignore` now. Does this fix the problem, and why or why not?",
      options: [
        "No, this does not fix it because the .env file is already in Git history and publicly visible; you must rotate your secrets and remove the file from history",
        "Yes, adding to .gitignore immediately hides the file and removes it from GitHub automatically fixing the security issue for you",
        "No, because .gitignore only works for public repositories and has no effect on private repositories with any secrets",
        "Yes, .gitignore prevents the file from being accessed by anyone who clones the repository going forward solving the problem"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Adding a file to .gitignore only prevents FUTURE commits from including it. If .env is already committed and pushed, it exists in Git history and is publicly visible on GitHub. Anyone can check out previous commits or view file history to see your secrets. The fix requires: (1) Remove .env from Git history using git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner, (2) Rotate (change) all exposed secrets immediately, (3) Add .env to .gitignore, (4) Commit and push.

If charset-normalizer is missing or incompatible, requests will fail when you try to use it. pip show reveals the dependency relationship, helping you understand that requests isn't a standalone package. This matters for troubleshooting—if requests throws an error, the problem might be in one of its dependencies. Option B is incorrect—you cannot delete these packages without breaking requests; they're all necessary. Option C misunderstands dependencies—pip installed these correctly; they're not mistakes.

The result is lines prefixed with counts like '15 ERROR: Database timeout'. Option B is incorrect—grep filters lines; it doesn't count them. Option C misunderstands sort -nr—it sorts by number in reverse order; it doesn't count anything, just reorders what uniq -c already counted.

For persistence across sessions and reboots, you need either (1) .env files loaded by your application or (2) shell configuration files like ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc that export variables on every shell startup. Option B is incorrect—sudo doesn't make export persistent; it would just run the export command with elevated privileges, which doesn't help.

For a successful copy, you should see: (1) both files exist (no 'not found' error), (2) identical sizes (same number of bytes), (3) target.txt has a recent timestamp (just copied). Different sizes or missing target.txt indicates copy failure. This is basic verification—the copy created a file of the correct size. Option B is incorrect—if target.txt doesn't exist, ls will error, telling you the copy failed. Option C is wrong—ls doesn't calculate hashes; it shows metadata.

Relative depends on current location; absolute doesn't. Option B is incorrect—you can absolutely combine .. with folders like ../../../projects/app/src.

Option B is partially useful—pip list shows Flask is installed, but doesn't confirm it's importable (it might be installed for a different Python version). Option C is irrelevant to verification—version matching is useful for compatibility, but doesn't tell you if it works. Even outdated versions can work fine.

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "export sets environment variables for the current shell session. When you close the terminal or open a new tab, that session ends and the variable is lost. To make PATH changes persistent, add the export command to your shell's startup file: ~/.bashrc (Bash) or ~/.zshrc (Zsh). Every new shell session loads this file and runs the export automatically. Option B is incorrect—sudo doesn't make export persistent; it runs with elevated privileges, which doesn't help here. Option C is wrong—session isolation is correct behavior, not a bug. Option D is nonsense—there's no 24-hour timer on export. Understanding session scope vs persistent configuration prevents confusion when terminal settings 'disappear.' Source: Lesson 5",

      question: "Your AI suggests `ls -la | grep ^d` to show only directories. What does ^d mean in grep's pattern matching, and why does it work?",
      options: [
        "The caret ^ means start of line, so ^d matches lines starting with d, which are directories in ls -la output format",
        "The ^ is a pipe operator that separates grep into two stages for more accurate directory filtering throughout the search",
        "The ^d means 'exclude files with d in the name' showing everything except directories for inverse filtering throughout the system",
        "The caret is a typo and should be removed because grep d works identically to filter directory names correctly"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "In grep regex patterns, ^ anchors to the start of a line. ^d means 'lines starting with d.' In ls -la output, directory lines start with 'd' (drwxr-xr-x), file lines start with '-' (-rw-r--r--). So grep ^d filters to only directory lines. This is more precise than grep d, which would also match files with 'd' anywhere in the name. Option B is incorrect—^ is not a pipe operator; | is the pipe operator. ^ is a regex anchor. Option C is backwards—^ doesn't exclude; it anchors. To exclude, you'd use grep -v (invert match). Option D is wrong—grep d matches any line containing 'd,' including files like 'old-data.txt.' grep ^d is specific to lines starting with d.

      question: "You install a package globally with `npm install -g typescript`. Later, `npm list` doesn't show it. Your AI says it is installed. What explains this?",
      options: [
        "Global packages install to a system location outside your project; npm list shows project packages only, use npm list -g for globals",
        "The npm install -g command failed silently and typescript was not actually installed despite the AI claiming it succeeded",
        "TypeScript is a special package that hides itself from npm list for security reasons and cannot be listed by standard commands",
        "The -g flag is not valid for npm and the command installed typescript locally with the flag being ignored by npm"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "npm install -g installs packages globally (system-wide, available to all projects). npm install (without -g) installs locally (in current project's node_modules). npm list shows local packages only. To see global packages, use npm list -g or npm list -g --depth=0 (for just top-level globals). TypeScript is installed at a system location like /usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript, not in your project. Both installation types are valid; they serve different purposes. Option B is incorrect—if installation succeeded, the package is there; npm list just doesn't show globals. Option C is nonsense—packages don't hide from listing. Option D is wrong—-g is perfectly valid; it changes install location to global. Understanding local vs global packages prevents confusion when packages 'disappear' from npm list. Source: Lesson 6",

        "AI should refuse to suggest any cd commands at all because navigation commands are too risky for users to execute"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The safety pattern requires AI to verify context before suggesting commands. Before cd, AI should: (1) show current location with pwd, (2) verify the target path exists (ls /path or test if directory exists), (3) explain what cd will do, (4) wait for confirmation. If the path doesn't exist, AI should say so and ask: 'This path doesn't exist. Do you want to create it with mkdir first?' This prevents executing commands destined to fail. Option B violates safety—intentionally running failing commands wastes time and doesn't teach verification. Option C misunderstands learning—errors have their place, but preventable errors should be prevented through verification. Option D overcompensates—cd is safe when used with verification.

      options: [
        "The first installs exactly version 2.31.0; the second installs the latest available version, which might differ over time",

        "The first installs a development version from source code; the second installs a pre-built binary package for production use"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "requests==2.31.0 pins to a specific version—you always get 2.31.0 no matter when you run it. requests (without version) installs whatever is latest on PyPI at execution time. In January it might install 2.31.0; in June it might install 2.32.0. Version pinning ensures reproducibility—everyone on your team gets the same version. Unpinned installs are flexible but can cause 'works on my machine' problems if different people get different versions. Most projects use requirements.txt with pinned versions for consistency. Option B is incorrect—pip respects version specifiers when provided. Option C is wrong—== is valid (exact version); >= is also valid (minimum version), as are &lt;=, ~=, etc. Option D misunderstands version syntax—== doesn't affect source vs binary; it specifies version number.

      options: [

        "You memorize the directory structure before asking AI to proceed so you can verify mentally without seeing any command output",
        "AI shows pwd only because ls output is redundant when you already know the current directory path from pwd showing location"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The safety pattern for file operations: (1) Ask—you request the operation ('move these files'), (2) AI shows context (pwd for location, ls for contents), (3) You verify context is correct, (4) AI explains what mv command will do, (5) You ask clarifying questions, (6) AI executes after confirmation. Context before action prevents operating in the wrong directory or moving the wrong files. Option B violates safety—executing before verification means mistakes can't be prevented. Option C misunderstands AI collaboration—you don't memorize; AI shows you and you verify visually. Option D is wrong—pwd shows location, ls shows what files are there. Both are necessary—pwd tells you where, ls tells you what. Together they provide complete context for safe operations. Source: Lesson 2 and Lesson 4",

        "It finds all Python files, limits output to 5 characters per filename, then deletes the files with cat removing them"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Trace the pipeline: find . -name '*.py' searches recursively for Python files and outputs their paths (one per line). The pipe sends this list to head -5, which takes only the first 5 paths. The pipe sends these 5 paths to xargs cat, which runs cat on each path, displaying their contents. Result: contents of the first 5 Python files found, concatenated. Option B is incorrect—this pipeline uses cat (display contents), not wc (count lines). Option C misunderstands head placement—head -5 limits to 5 files, not 5 lines per file. For 5 lines per file, you'd need cat file | head -5. Option D is wrong—cat displays file contents; it doesn't delete files. Understanding pipeline data flow helps you predict output and modify commands. Source: Lesson 7",

      question: "You ask AI to delete log files older than 7 days. It suggests a complex find command with -mtime. You don't understand -mtime. What's the AI-native development approach?",
      options: [
        "Ask AI to explain what -mtime +7 means and how it filters files by age before executing the deletion command safely",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "AI-native development means asking AI to explain unfamiliar parts before execution. Ask: 'What does -mtime +7 do? How does it determine file age?' AI will explain: -mtime +7 matches files modified more than 7 days ago. +7 means 'greater than 7 days old,' -7 would mean 'less than 7 days old,' 7 means exactly 7 days. Now you understand the filter logic and can verify it matches your intent. Option B is dangerous—never execute without understanding, especially for destructive operations like deletion. Option C is unnecessary—you don't need to master all of find; just understand this specific use case. Option D defeats automation—manually checking files wastes time and is error-prone.

      options: [
        "Yes, important-data-backup.csv still exists with original contents; this demonstrates why copy operations create safety before risky changes",
        "No, deleting important-data.csv also deletes all backups automatically because bash prevents orphaned backup files from existing alone",
        "Yes, by running cp --undo which restores the most recent deleted file from bash's automatic backup system built into the command",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "When you cp file.csv backup.csv, you create two independent copies. Deleting file.csv doesn't affect backup.csv—it's a separate file with separate content. You can recover by copying back: cp important-data-backup.csv important-data.csv. This is why AI suggests backups before risky operations—copy creates a safety net. If something goes wrong, you have the original. Option B is incorrect—deleting one file doesn't affect other files; copies are independent. Option C is wrong—there's no cp --undo command. bash doesn't have automatic backup. Option D misunderstands how files work—copies are separate entities.

      explanation: "export sets variables for the current shell session only. If you run export API_KEY='sk-123' in Terminal Tab A, then run python script.py in Terminal Tab B (a different session), Tab B doesn't have API_KEY. Solutions: (1) Run export and python script in the same tab, or (2) Use a .env file that the script loads (not session-dependent), or (3) Add export to ~/.bashrc so it's set in all new sessions. Option B is incorrect—Python absolutely can access export variables via os.getenv() when in the same session. Option C is nonsense—export works with any valid variable name regardless of length. Option D is wrong—os.getenv() is not deprecated and works fine; os.environ[] raises errors if missing while os.getenv() returns None, but both access environment variables.

      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Pipes work left to right, passing output to the next command. Current pipeline: cat outputs all lines → grep filters to ERROR lines → output shows error messages. To count, add wc -l at the end: cat file.txt | grep ERROR | wc -l. Now: cat outputs all lines → grep filters to ERROR lines → wc -l counts those filtered lines → output shows count. Each command transforms the data. Option B is incorrect—you CAN combine filtering and counting; that's the power of pipes. Option C is backwards—counting first (wc -l counts all lines) then filtering would filter the count number, which makes no sense. Option D is wrong—wc -l before grep would count all lines, then grep would filter the count output (meaningless). Understanding sequential pipeline flow helps you add commands in the right position.
