  questions={[
    {
      question: "What does type(MyClass) return when MyClass is a normal user-defined class?",
      options: [
        "<class 'type'> because type creates all classes automatically",
        "<class 'object'> because all classes inherit from object",
        "<class 'MyClass'> showing it is self-referential by design",
        "NameError because type() requires instance not class name"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. In Python, all classes are instances of the 'type' metaclass by default. When you write 'class MyClass:', Python uses type to create the MyClass class object. type is the metaclass that creates classes. Option 2 is wrong—object is the base class, not the metaclass. Option 3 confuses the class with its type. Option 4 is false—type() works with both instances and classes. Understanding that classes are objects created by type is fundamental to metaclasses, as explained in Lesson 1.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Understanding Metaclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "When you use type(name, bases, namespace) to create a class dynamically, what is the bases parameter?",
      options: [
        "Tuple of parent classes from which dynamically created",
        "Dictionary of methods to add to class namespace",
        "String naming the base module for class imports",
        "List of attribute names required for class validation"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. The bases parameter is a tuple of parent classes (e.g., (object,) or (SomeParent,)). When creating classes dynamically with type(name, bases, namespace), Python uses these bases for inheritance, just like when you write 'class MyClass(Parent):'. Option 2 confuses bases with the namespace parameter (the third argument). Option 3 invents a non-existent module naming system. Option 4 misunderstands the purpose—bases aren't for validation, they're for inheritance. This is the class factory pattern for dynamic class creation, covered in Lesson 1.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Understanding Metaclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "In a custom metaclass, what is the first parameter convention for the __new__ method?",
      options: [
        "self referring to the instance being created currently",
        "cls referring to the class object being created",
        "mcs referring to the metaclass itself controlling creation",
        "meta referring to metadata dictionary for class attributes"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. By convention, the first parameter of a metaclass's __new__ method is 'mcs' (short for metaclass), not 'cls' or 'self'. This distinguishes it from regular class methods. mcs refers to the metaclass itself (e.g., MyMeta), not the class being created. Option 1 is wrong—'self' is for instance methods. Option 2 uses 'cls' which is for class methods, not metaclass methods. Option 4 invents a non-existent convention. Using mcs makes metaclass code clearer and follows Python conventions, as shown in Lesson 1.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Understanding Metaclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you try to instantiate an abstract base class with @abstractmethod process()?",
      options: [
        "Instance is created but process() raises NotImplementedError when called",
        "Python raises TypeError at instantiation preventing object creation immediately",
        "Python issues a warning but allows instantiation for testing",
        "Abstract methods are automatically implemented with empty pass statements"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. ABC with @abstractmethod prevents instantiation at class level. Calling Agent() immediately raises TypeError: \"Can't instantiate abstract class Agent with abstract method process\". This catches errors early (at object creation) rather than late (at method call). Option 1 describes the old pattern of raising NotImplementedError in method bodies—less safe because error occurs at runtime. Option 3 is false—Python strictly prevents ABC instantiation. Option 4 misunderstands @abstractmethod—abstract methods have no default implementation. This enforcement is why ABCs are superior to informal base classes, explained in Lesson 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Practical Metaclass Patterns"
    },
    {
      question: "Why must a plugin registration metaclass skip registering the base class itself?",
      options: [
        "Base class has no implementation so registration would",
        "Python automatically registers base classes in separate registry",
        "Base class would pollute the registry with abstract placeholder",
        "Registration only works for concrete classes not abstract"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. In registration metaclasses, you check 'if name != \"Plugin\"' to avoid registering the abstract base class. The base class is just a framework—it's not a usable plugin. Registering it would pollute the registry with a non-functional entry. Only concrete subclasses should be registered. Option 1 is wrong—base classes can have implementations; that's not the issue. Option 2 is false—Python doesn't auto-register anything. Option 4 misunderstands—registration works for any class, but you choose to skip the base for architectural reasons. This pattern prevents registry pollution, demonstrated in Lesson 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Practical Metaclass Patterns"
    },
    {
      question: "When would __init_subclass__ be preferable to creating a custom metaclass for validation?",
      options: [
        "When you need to customize how classes are created",
        "When you want simpler code that validates subclasses at creation",
        "When you need to intercept class instantiation with __call__",
        "Never, metaclasses are always better for class validation"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. __init_subclass__ is simpler and more readable for validating subclasses. It runs when a subclass is created and can validate attributes, raise errors, etc. Use it for 80% of metaclass use cases. Metaclasses are only needed when you must customize __call__ (instantiation), modify the entire class hierarchy, or need pre-Python 3.6 compatibility. Option 1 describes metaclass use cases, not when to use __init_subclass__. Option 3 is a metaclass-specific need. Option 4 is false—simplicity matters. This decision framework is explained in Lesson 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Practical Metaclass Patterns"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary advantage of type hints in dataclasses compared to traditional classes?",
      options: [
        "Type hints are optional in dataclasses but required",
        "Type hints make dataclasses run faster than traditional classes",
        "Type hints tell @dataclass which variables are fields needing",
        "Type hints enable automatic database schema generation for models"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. In dataclasses, type hints are mandatory because they distinguish fields from class variables. The @dataclass decorator reads type hints to know which attributes to include in __init__, __repr__, etc. Without type hints, Python can't tell if 'name = \"default\"' is a class variable or a field. Option 1 is backwards—type hints are required for dataclass fields. Option 2 is false—performance is negligible. Option 4 describes framework features (like Django), not dataclass behavior. Type hints as field declarations is the core dataclass mechanism, explained in Lesson 3.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Introduction to Dataclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "What does frozen=True do when creating a dataclass?",
      options: [
        "Makes instances immutable preventing attribute modification after creation",
        "Freezes the class definition preventing new subclasses from inheriting",
        "Caches all instances in memory for faster access",
        "Converts all mutable fields to immutable types automatically"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. frozen=True makes dataclass instances immutable—you can't change attributes after creation. Attempting to modify raises FrozenInstanceError. This is useful for configuration objects, dictionary keys (frozen instances are hashable), and thread safety. Option 2 misunderstands—frozen affects instances, not inheritance. Option 3 invents a non-existent caching feature. Option 4 is wrong—frozen doesn't change field types, it prevents modification. Immutable dataclasses are valuable for data integrity and thread safety, covered in Lesson 3.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Introduction to Dataclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "Why must fields without defaults come before fields with defaults in a dataclass?",
      options: [
        "Python requires this for __init__ parameter order to be",
        "Dataclass decorator fails to generate code if order wrong",
        "Default fields must be at end for alphabetical sorting",
        "Required fields take priority over optional in method resolution"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Python function signatures require non-default parameters before default parameters. Since @dataclass generates __init__, it must follow this rule. If you put 'age: int = 0' before 'name: str', the generated __init__ would be invalid: __init__(self, age=0, name) is illegal. Option 2 is imprecise—the decorator does fail, but because of the underlying __init__ signature rule. Option 3 is nonsense—alphabetical sorting is irrelevant. Option 4 invents a non-existent concept. This Python requirement applies to all functions, including dataclass-generated ones, explained in Lesson 3.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Introduction to Dataclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "What does order=True enable when creating a dataclass?",
      options: [
        "Automatically generates comparison methods for sorting instances by fields",
        "Maintains insertion order for dictionary-like field access patterns",
        "Orders fields alphabetically for consistent repr output always",
        "Enables ordered iteration over instances in creation sequence"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. order=True auto-generates comparison methods (__lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__), enabling sorting. Python compares fields left-to-right (lexicographic order). This lets you sort dataclass instances or use min/max. Option 2 confuses field order with dictionary insertion order (unrelated). Option 3 is false—field order comes from definition order, not alphabetical. Option 4 invents a non-existent iteration feature. The key: order=True makes instances comparable and sortable based on field values, demonstrated in Lesson 3.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Introduction to Dataclasses"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the correct way to define a mutable default for a list field in a dataclass?",
      options: [
        "items: list = [] works correctly in dataclasses",
        "items: list = field(default_factory=list) creates new list each",
        "items: list = None then convert to list in __post_init__",
        "items: list = field(default=[]) preserves empty list default"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. field(default_factory=list) calls list() for each instance, creating a new list. This prevents shared mutable state. Option 1 raises ValueError in Python 3.10+ (mutable defaults not allowed). Even in older Python, it creates a shared list across all instances—a bug. Option 3 works but is verbose and less clear than default_factory. Option 4 is wrong—field(default=[]) would still share the list. Using default_factory is the mandatory pattern for mutable defaults, a critical gotcha explained in Lesson 4.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Advanced Dataclass Features"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of __post_init__() in a dataclass?",
      options: [
        "Validate fields and compute derived attributes after __init__ completes",
        "Initialize parent class attributes before dataclass fields are set",
        "Convert field types automatically from input to declared types",
        "Register the instance in a global registry after creation"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. __post_init__() runs immediately after the auto-generated __init__() finishes. Use it to validate field values (raise ValueError if invalid) or compute derived fields that depend on constructor parameters. This enables fail-fast validation at instance creation. Option 2 is backwards—__post_init__ runs after, not before, initialization. Option 3 invents auto-conversion (dataclasses don't do this). Option 4 is a possible use case but not the primary purpose. __post_init__() is the validation and computation hook, essential for production dataclasses, covered in Lesson 4.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Advanced Dataclass Features"
    },
    {
      question: "When should you use InitVar in a dataclass field definition?",
      options: [
        "When the field should be passed to __init__ but",
        "When the field needs initialization from environment variables only",
        "When the field value should come from parent class",
        "When the field must be validated before storage occurs"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. InitVar fields appear in __init__() signature and are passed to __post_init__(), but are NOT stored as instance attributes. Example: password: InitVar[str] lets you pass a password to __post_init__() for hashing, but the password itself isn't stored (only password_hash is). Option 2 misunderstands—InitVar is for temporary initialization data, not environment variables specifically. Option 3 confuses initialization with inheritance. Option 4 describes validation (possible with InitVar) but doesn't capture its defining characteristic. InitVar is for transient initialization data, explained in Lesson 4.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Advanced Dataclass Features"
    },
    {
      question: "What does field(repr=False) do in a dataclass?",
      options: [
        "Excludes the field from __repr__ string representation for security",
        "Prevents the field from being included in __init__ parameters",
        "Makes the field read-only after instance creation occurs",
        "Converts the field to a property instead of attribute"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. repr=False excludes the field from the auto-generated __repr__ output. This is useful for sensitive data (passwords, API keys) that shouldn't appear in logs or debug output. The field is still stored and accessible, just hidden from repr. Option 2 confuses repr=False with init=False. Option 3 invents a non-existent immutability feature (use frozen=True for that). Option 4 is completely wrong—field() doesn't create properties. Using repr=False protects sensitive data while keeping it accessible to code, a security practice shown in Lesson 4.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Advanced Dataclass Features"
    },
    {
      question: "What function converts a dataclass instance to a dictionary for JSON serialization?",
      options: [
        "to_dict() method available on all dataclass instances",
        "dict(instance) using Python's built-in dict constructor automatically",
        "asdict(instance) from dataclasses module handles nested dataclasses",
        "json.dumps(instance) automatically serializes dataclasses to JSON format"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. The asdict() function from dataclasses module recursively converts a dataclass instance to a dict, handling nested dataclasses correctly. Then use json.dumps(dict) for JSON. Option 1 invents a method—dataclasses don't have to_dict(). Option 2 is wrong—dict(instance) doesn't work on dataclasses. Option 4 is false—json.dumps() doesn't natively handle dataclasses; you must convert to dict first. The pattern is: asdict(instance) → dict → json.dumps(dict), demonstrated in Lesson 4.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Advanced Dataclass Features"
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't you use field(metadata={...}) alone to enforce validation rules?",
      options: [
        "Metadata is read-only and cannot be modified at",
        "Metadata is just arbitrary data and doesn't auto-validate fields",
        "Only Python 3.14+ supports metadata validation features natively",
        "Metadata requires additional decorator to activate validation logic"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Field metadata is passive—it stores arbitrary information but doesn't automatically validate anything. You must write validation logic in __post_init__() that reads the metadata and enforces rules. Example: field(metadata={'min': 0, 'max': 150}) stores the constraints, but your __post_init__ must check them. Option 1 is wrong—metadata being read-only doesn't prevent validation. Option 3 is false—metadata existed before 3.14. Option 4 invents a non-existent decorator system. Metadata is for storing validation rules; __post_init__() enforces them, as explained in Lesson 4.",

      question: "When choosing between a metaclass and a dataclass for an API response model, which is most appropriate?",

        "Dataclass because API models are primarily data containers with",
        "Metaclass because it provides better JSON serialization support built-in",
        "Neither, use traditional class for proper API response handling"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. API response models are data containers—they hold fields like id, name, created_at with minimal behavior. Dataclasses eliminate boilerplate for __init__, __repr__, __eq__ and provide clean type-safe structure. Metaclasses would be over-engineering. Option 1 misunderstands—API responses don't need class creation customization. Option 3 is backwards—dataclasses have better serialization support (asdict()). Option 4 ignores that dataclasses ARE classes, just with auto-generated boilerplate. Dataclasses excel at data modeling, as demonstrated throughout Lesson 5.",

        "Metaclass generates HTML forms automatically from model field types"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Django's ModelBase metaclass inspects class definitions at creation time, finds all Field instances (CharField, IntegerField, etc.), and builds database schema automatically. This turns Python class syntax into database tables. Option 2 is false—metaclasses don't affect query performance. Option 3 misunderstands—metaclasses don't validate queries; Django's ORM does. Option 4 describes Django forms, a separate feature. The metaclass's job is schema generation from declarative field definitions, a framework design pattern explained in Lesson 5.",

      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. Traditional classes are appropriate when behavior dominates over data. Example: BankAccount with deposit(), withdraw(), get_balance() methods that enforce business rules. Dataclasses excel at data modeling, not complex stateful behavior. Option 1 is backwards—data storage is exactly when to use dataclasses. Option 2 is wrong—dataclasses support immutability with frozen=True. Option 4 describes dataclass benefits, not reasons to avoid them. Use traditional classes for rich behavior; dataclasses for clean data structures, a decision framework from Lesson 5.",

      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. With a metaclass, plugin registration happens automatically—just inherit from BasePlugin and the metaclass registers you. With decorators, developers must remember @register on each plugin (error-prone). Metaclasses enforce registration through inheritance. Option 1 is false—performance is negligible. Option 2 is wrong—both can modify classes. Option 4 is incorrect—error quality is implementation-dependent.

Type hints make the distinction explicit: annotated attributes are fields, non-annotated are class variables. Option 1 is false—performance is irrelevant to the design choice.
