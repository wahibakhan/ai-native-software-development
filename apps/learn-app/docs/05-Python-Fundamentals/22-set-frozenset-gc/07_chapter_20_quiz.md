  questions={[    {
      question: "You create a list with duplicate values: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4]`. What happens when you convert it to a set?",
      options: [
        "Duplicates are marked as invalid",
        "Raises ValueError for duplicate elements",
        "Keeps duplicates in unordered positions",
        "Duplicates are removed automatically"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Sets automatically eliminate duplicates because of the uniqueness property. When you convert `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4]` to a set, it becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4}`—the duplicate 1 and 2 are removed. Option 2 is wrong because Python doesn't raise errors for duplicates in sets; it silently removes them. Option 3 is wrong because sets don't keep duplicates at all, ordered or unordered. Option 4 is wrong because there's no marking mechanism; duplicates are simply eliminated during set creation. This automatic deduplication is a core set feature, making sets ideal for extracting unique values from collections with potential duplicates.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Set Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does attempting `my_set = {[1, 2], [3, 4]}` raise a TypeError?",
      options: [
        "Lists aren't hashable because they're mutable",
        "Sets require homogeneous types only",
        "Lists can't be nested inside sets",
        "Sets don't support bracket notation"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Lists cannot be set elements because they're mutable (changeable), and mutable objects aren't hashable. Sets require hashable elements because they use hash values for O(1) lookup. If a list could be in a set and then you modified it, the hash value would change, breaking the set's internal structure. Option 2 is wrong because sets can contain mixed immutable types like `{1, 'a', (2, 3)}`. Option 3 is misleading—lists can't be nested because they're unhashable, not because of nesting restrictions. Option 4 is wrong because bracket notation has nothing to do with this error; the issue is mutability. To store sequences in sets, use immutable tuples instead: `{(1, 2), (3, 4)}`.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Set Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the primary difference between `my_set.remove(x)` and `my_set.discard(x)` when `x` doesn't exist?",
      options: [
        "discard() raises KeyError; remove() does nothing",
        "remove() raises KeyError; discard() does nothing",
        "Both raise KeyError for missing elements",
        "Both silently ignore missing elements completely"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The key difference is error handling: `remove(x)` raises a KeyError if x doesn't exist in the set, while `discard(x)` silently does nothing. Use `remove()` when you're certain the element exists and want an error if it doesn't (defensive programming). Use `discard()` when you want to ensure an element is gone regardless of whether it was there initially. Option 2 reverses the behavior. Option 3 is wrong because `discard()` specifically doesn't raise errors. Option 4 is wrong because `remove()` does raise errors. This design mirrors the difference between dict access with brackets `dict[key]` (raises KeyError) versus `dict.get(key)` (returns None).",

    },
    {
      question: "You need to track unique user IDs from millions of login events. Which structure provides O(1) membership checking?",
      options: [
        "Tuple because immutability improves performance significantly",
        "List because indexed access is constant time",
        "Set because hash-based lookup is constant time",
        "Dict because key-value pairs are faster"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Sets provide O(1) average-case membership checking using hash tables. When you check `user_id in user_set`, Python computes the hash, jumps to the slot, and finds the element instantly—regardless of set size. With millions of IDs, this is dramatically faster than lists. Option 2 is wrong because list membership checking (`in` operator) is O(n)—it checks each element sequentially. Indexed access like `list[5]` is O(1), but membership checking is not. Option 3 is wrong because tuples have the same O(n) membership checking as lists. Option 4 is misleading—dicts also provide O(1) lookup, but only for keys. If you only need membership, sets are more appropriate than dicts.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Set Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "Why must you use `set()` to create an empty set instead of `{}`?",
      options: [
        "Empty sets need the constructor syntax",
        "Python requires explicit type hints always",
        "Braces are reserved for frozenset creation",
        "Empty braces create an empty dictionary"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The syntax `{}` creates an empty dictionary, not an empty set. This is a historical quirk: dictionaries existed in Python before sets, so `{}` was already claimed. To create an empty set, you must use the `set()` constructor. Option 2 is wrong because type hints are optional in Python, not required. Option 3 is wrong because frozensets use `frozenset()`, not braces. Option 4 is partially true but doesn't explain why—the real reason is that `{}` is already reserved for dicts. Non-empty sets can use braces: `{1, 2, 3}` is unambiguous because the presence of elements (not key-value pairs) signals it's a set.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Set Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the result of `{1, 2, 3} | {3, 4, 5}` and what operation does `|` perform?",
      options: [
        "Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} combining all elements",
        "Intersection: {3} containing only shared elements",
        "Difference: {1, 2} containing first set's unique items",
        "Symmetric difference: {1, 2, 4, 5} excluding shared"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The `|` operator performs set union, combining all elements from both sets. `{1, 2, 3} | {3, 4, 5}` produces `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`—all unique elements from both sets. The duplicate 3 appears only once because sets enforce uniqueness. Option 2 describes the `&` (intersection) operator, which produces `{3}`. Option 3 describes the `-` (difference) operator, which produces `{1, 2}`. Option 4 describes the `^` (symmetric difference) operator, which produces `{1, 2, 4, 5}`. Union is useful for combining datasets—like merging user sets from different sources while automatically removing duplicates.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Set Operations"
    },
    {
      question: "When would you use `set_a & set_b` instead of `set_a | set_b` in production code?",
      options: [
        "Combining all unique items from collections",
        "Finding common items between two collections",
        "Removing duplicates from merged data sets",
        "Checking if sets have identical contents"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The `&` (intersection) operator finds elements that exist in BOTH sets, making it ideal for finding commonalities. Use cases include: finding users who are in both groups, identifying shared tags, or discovering overlapping IDs. Option 2 describes union (`|`), which combines all elements. Option 3 is also union—merging and deduplicating. Option 4 describes equality checking (`==`), not intersection. Intersection is powerful in data analysis: if you have `active_users` and `premium_users`, then `active_users & premium_users` gives you active premium users specifically. This is more readable and efficient than looping through both sets manually.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Set Operations"
    },
    {
      question: "What does `{1, 2, 3} - {2, 3, 4}` produce and when is this operation useful?",
      options: [
        "Union: {1, 2, 3, 4} combining elements",
        "Intersection: {2, 3} containing shared elements only",
        "Difference: {1} containing first set's unique items",
        "Symmetric difference: {1, 4} excluding shared items"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The `-` (difference) operator produces `{1}`—elements in the first set but not in the second. This answers 'what does the first set have that the second doesn't?' Use cases include: finding users who haven't completed a task (all_users - completed_users), identifying missing items (required_ids - processed_ids), or filtering out unwanted elements. Option 2 describes `&` (intersection). Option 3 describes `|` (union). Option 4 describes `^` (symmetric difference). Difference is asymmetric: `A - B` differs from `B - A`. In the example, `{2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3}` would give `{4}`, not `{1}`.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Set Operations"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does `{1, 2, 3}.issubset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})` return True while `{1, 2, 6}.issubset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})` returns False?",
      options: [
        "First set's all elements exist in second",
        "Subsets require exactly half the elements match",
        "Second set must contain duplicate values",
        "Sets must share at least one element"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "A subset relationship means every element in the first set exists in the second set. `{1, 2, 3}` is a subset of `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` because all three elements (1, 2, 3) are present in the larger set. `{1, 2, 6}` is not a subset because 6 doesn't exist in the second set. Option 2 is wrong—subsets don't have size requirements; even `{1}` is a subset of `{1, 2, 3}`. Option 3 is wrong because sets never contain duplicates. Option 4 describes set overlap, not subset. Use cases for `issubset()`: checking if user permissions are within allowed permissions, verifying required features are available, or testing if dependencies are satisfied.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Set Operations"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the output of `{x**2 for x in range(6) if x % 2 == 0}` and why?",
      options: [
        "Set {0, 4, 16} of squared evens"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Set comprehensions use `{...}` syntax with an expression and optional filter. This produces `{0, 4, 16}`—the squares of even numbers from range(6). The `if x % 2 == 0` filter selects evens (0, 2, 4), then `x**2` squares each (0, 4, 16). Option 2 is wrong because `{...}` creates a set, not a list. List comprehensions use `[...]`. Option 3 is wrong because the filter removes odds (1, 3, 5). Option 4 is wrong because the expression `x**2` squares values; it doesn't just filter evens. Set comprehensions are useful for building unique transformed values: `{user.email for user in users if user.is_active}` creates unique active user emails.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Set Operations"
    },
    {
      question: "You ask AI to 'find common tags between two blog posts.' It generates `set_a | set_b`. What should you request?",
      options: [
        "Use difference (-) to find unique tags",
        "Union is correct for finding shared tags",
        "Use intersection (&) instead for common items",
        "Use symmetric difference (^) for matching tags"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Finding common items requires intersection (`&`), not union (`|`). Union combines all unique elements from both sets, which is the opposite of finding shared elements. The correct code is `set_a & set_b`, which returns elements present in BOTH sets. Option 2 is wrong—union doesn't find shared items; it merges all items. Option 3 is wrong—difference finds items unique to one set, not common to both. Option 4 is wrong—symmetric difference finds items in either set but NOT both, which excludes common items. This is a common AI-generation error: confusing union with intersection. Always verify that the operation matches your intent: & for commonalities, | for merging.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Set Operations"
    },
    {
      question: "Why is checking `user_id in active_users` O(1) for sets but O(n) for lists with millions of users?",
      options: [
        "Lists use binary search for faster access",
        "Sets use hash tables for instant lookup",
        "Sets pre-sort elements for quick searching",
        "Lists require sequential scanning through all items"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Sets use hash tables, which enable O(1) average-case lookup. When you check `user_id in active_users`, Python computes the hash of `user_id`, jumps directly to that slot in the hash table, and checks if it's there—instant, regardless of set size. Lists require O(n) linear search: Python checks element 0, then 1, then 2, until it finds the value or reaches the end. With 1 million users, set lookup is nearly instant; list lookup could check thousands of elements. Option 2 is wrong—lists don't use binary search for the `in` operator (binary search requires sorted data and isn't automatic). Option 3 is wrong—sets are unordered and don't sort. Option 4 describes the problem, not the solution. This performance difference is why sets are critical for large-scale membership checking.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Set Internals & Hashing"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes an object hashable in Python, and why does this matter for sets?",
      options: [
        "Hashability requires implementing custom __hash__ methods",
        "All objects are hashable by default",
        "Hashable objects must be numeric types",
        "Immutability ensures stable hash values for lookup"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Hashable objects are immutable, meaning their hash value never changes after creation. Sets require hashable elements because they store items in hash table slots based on hash values. If an object could change after being added to a set, its hash would change, and lookups would break. Immutable types (int, str, tuple, frozenset) are hashable; mutable types (list, dict, set) are not. Option 2 is wrong—mutable objects like lists aren't hashable. Option 3 is wrong—strings and tuples are hashable despite being non-numeric. Option 4 is wrong—built-in immutable types are automatically hashable without custom code. The connection: sets use hash(element) to determine storage location, so hash stability is essential for correctness.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Set Internals & Hashing"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does `hash('hello')` return the same value every time within a session but might differ between Python sessions?",
      options: [
        "Hashing is deterministic per session for consistency",
        "Hashing uses random values for every call",
        "String hashes are cached globally forever",
        "Hashes change based on string length"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Hash functions are deterministic within a session—the same input always produces the same hash value. This ensures set lookups work correctly: if you add 'hello' to a set, you need `hash('hello')` to return the same value when checking membership later. However, Python uses hash randomization across sessions for security reasons (prevents hash collision attacks). Option 2 is wrong—hashes must be consistent within a session. Option 3 is wrong—hashes aren't cached globally; they're computed each time but produce consistent results. Option 4 is wrong—hashes aren't based on length; they're computed from content. This consistency matters because sets rely on stable hashing: `my_set.add('hello')` followed by `'hello' in my_set` must find the element.",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you try to add a dictionary to a set: `my_set.add({'key': 'value'})`?",

        "Converts dictionary to frozenset automatically for storage",
        "Raises TypeError because dicts aren't hashable",
        "Adds dictionary keys but ignores values"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Dictionaries are mutable, so they're unhashable and cannot be set elements. Attempting `my_set.add({'key': 'value'})` raises `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`. If dicts could be in sets, you could modify the dict after adding it, changing its hash value and breaking the set's lookup structure. Option 2 is wrong—Python doesn't automatically convert types. Option 3 is wrong—it fails with an error. Option 4 is wrong—no partial adding occurs. To store dict-like data in sets, use frozensets (immutable set variant) or tuples of key-value pairs: `{(('key', 'value'),)}` works because tuples are immutable and hashable.",

      question: "When comparing sets vs. lists for 1 million elements, which operation shows the most dramatic performance difference?",
      options: [
        "Iteration speed is dramatically faster for sets",
        "Membership checking (in operator) shows dramatic difference",
        "Memory usage is dramatically lower for sets",
        "Adding elements is dramatically faster for sets"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Membership checking (`x in collection`) shows the most dramatic performance difference: O(1) for sets vs. O(n) for lists. With 1 million elements, set lookup is nearly instant; list lookup averages 500,000 comparisons. The difference can be 1000x or more. Option 2 is wrong—iteration is similar speed for both (O(n) for both). Option 3 is wrong—sets often use MORE memory than lists due to hash table overhead. Option 4 is wrong—adding elements is fast for both in most cases. The key insight: when you need frequent membership checks on large collections, sets are dramatically faster. This matters in production: checking if user IDs exist, validating against allowed values, or deduplicating large datasets.",

        "Python eliminates all collisions automatically with resizing",
        "Collisions slow lookups; worst case is linear time"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Hash collisions occur when multiple objects hash to the same slot. Sets handle collisions through chaining or probing, but this adds overhead. In the worst case (all elements collide to one slot), lookup degrades to O(n). However, Python's hash functions and automatic resizing make collisions rare, so O(1) average case is reliable. Option 2 is wrong—collisions slow performance, not improve it. Option 3 is wrong—resizing reduces collisions but can't eliminate them entirely. Option 4 is wrong—collisions are mathematically inevitable when the hash space is smaller than the number of possible objects. The practical takeaway: O(1) is 'average case,' but even with collisions, sets are dramatically faster than lists for membership checks.",

      explanation: "Frozensets are immutable—they cannot be modified after creation. They have no `.add()`, `.remove()`, or `.discard()` methods. Regular sets are mutable and can be changed anytime with `.add()`, `.remove()`, etc. This immutability makes frozensets hashable, enabling them to be dictionary keys or members of other sets. Option 2 reverses the behavior—sets ARE mutable. Option 3 is wrong because frozensets don't have mutation methods. Option 4 is wrong because regular sets are mutable. The trade-off: frozensets sacrifice modification capability to gain hashability. Choose frozensets when you need immutability or want to use sets as dict keys.",

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Dictionary keys must be hashable, and hashable objects must be immutable. Frozensets are immutable (can't change after creation), making them hashable. Regular sets are mutable, so they're unhashable and cannot be dict keys. Attempting `{my_set: value}` raises `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'`. Option 2 is wrong—there's no special storage; immutability is the requirement. Option 3 is wrong—sets aren't hashable at all. Option 4 is wrong—Python doesn't auto-convert; you must explicitly create frozensets. Use case: permission levels as frozenset keys: `{frozenset(['admin']): 'full_access'}` works because frozensets can't be modified, ensuring dict lookup integrity.",

Regular sets and lists are unhashable (mutable), so they cannot be set members. Option 2 fails with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'`. Option 3 works but doesn't provide set-level uniqueness or O(1) group lookup. Option 4 fails with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. This pattern is common in data analysis: tracking unique groups, modeling relationships, or finding group overlaps.

Attempting `my_frozen.add(5)` raises `AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'`. The error is AttributeError (method doesn't exist), not TypeError (operation not supported). Option 2 uses the wrong error type. Option 3 is wrong—frozensets don't create modified copies automatically; you must manually create a new frozenset. Option 4 is wrong—an error is raised, not silently ignored. If you need to 'modify' a frozenset, create a new one: `new_frozen = frozenset(list(my_frozen) + [5])`.

Common use cases include: permission levels as dict keys, immutable group membership, or configuration constants. Options 2, 3, and 4 all require modification capabilities, which frozensets don't provide—use regular sets for those scenarios. Frozensets trade modification ability for hashability and immutability guarantees. The decision framework: if you need to use a set as a key or member, you must use frozenset.

Option 2 is wrong—frozensets cannot be modified. Option 3 is wrong—operations return frozensets when applied to frozensets. Option 4 is wrong—frozensets support all read-only operations. The key difference from sets: with sets, you can use `.update()` to modify in-place; with frozensets, all operations create new frozensets. This immutability ensures hash values remain stable.",

      explanation: "Python uses reference counting as the primary memory management mechanism. Every object has a reference count: how many variables point to it. When you create an object, count starts at 1. When you add a reference, it increases. When you delete a reference (variable goes out of scope or is deleted), it decreases. When the count reaches zero, Python immediately frees the memory. Option 2 describes the cyclic garbage collector, which is a backup for circular references, not the primary mechanism.

Each object's reference count is at least 1 (from the other object), even when no external variables reference them. Reference counting alone can't detect this: the counts never reach zero, so memory is never freed. Python's cyclic garbage collector solves this by periodically finding unreachable cycles and freeing them. Option 2 is wrong—reference counting works fine with mutable objects.

Option 2 confuses `id()` with `hash()`—they're different. Option 3 describes `type(obj).__name__`. Option 4 describes `sys.getrefcount()`. Usage: `before_ids = {id(obj) for obj in gc.get_objects()}; after_ids = {id(obj) for obj in gc.get_objects()}; surviving = before_ids & after_ids` finds objects that existed in both snapshots.",

      question: "When building a memory profiler, why use sets for object ID tracking instead of lists?",

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Sets provide O(1) membership checking: `if obj_id in seen_ids` is instant regardless of set size. Lists require O(n) scanning through all elements. When tracking millions of objects, this performance difference is critical. Option 2 is wrong—sets don't affect GC behavior. Option 3 is wrong—lists store IDs fine; performance is the issue. Option 4 is backwards—lists preserve order, but profiling doesn't need order; it needs fast lookups. Typical profiler pattern: maintaining a `seen_ids` set and checking `if id(obj) not in seen_ids: # new object discovered` thousands of times per second. With sets, this is efficient; with lists, it's prohibitively slow.",

      question: "You notice your memory profiler itself is consuming significant memory. What's the likely cause?",

        "Storing references instead of IDs keeps objects alive",
        "Using sets instead of lists wastes memory",
        "gc.get_objects() prevents garbage collection globally",

      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "If your profiler stores actual object references (even in snapshots), those references prevent garbage collection of those objects—your profiler keeps them alive. Store IDs instead: `id(obj)` is just an integer, not a reference. IDs don't prevent GC. Option 2 is wrong—sets may use more memory than lists, but not significantly enough to be the primary issue. Option 3 is wrong—`gc.get_objects()` doesn't prevent GC. Option 4 is wrong—frozensets store references/IDs, not duplicate objects. Fix: change `snapshot = [obj for obj in gc.get_objects()]` to `snapshot = {id(obj) for obj in gc.get_objects()}`. The former keeps all objects alive; the latter just stores numbers.",
