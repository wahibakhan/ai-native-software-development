# Memory Profiler Capstone: Building an Object Tracking Tool

🚀 **What You'll Build**: A working Memory Profiler tool that tracks Python objects, displays memory statistics, and handles edge cases. This capstone integrates **everything** you've learned in Chapter 24: sets for tracking, frozensets for organization, garbage collection for analysis, and AI collaboration for design.

**Duration**: 60 minutes (design 10 min + implement 20 min + test 15 min + reflect 10 min + reflection 5 min)

**Complexity**: B1-B2 Intermediate-Advanced (You're synthesizing multiple concepts into a working system)

---

## 💬 Why This Capstone Matters

Throughout Chapter 24, you've learned individual concepts:
- **Lesson 1**: Sets for fast membership testing
- **Lesson 2**: Set operations for data analysis
- **Lesson 3**: Hash tables and O(1) performance
- **Lesson 4**: Frozensets as immutable, hashable types
- **Lesson 5**: Garbage collection and reference counting

Now you'll see how these concepts work **together** to solve a real problem: understanding Python memory usage. This capstone is portfolio-worthy—you're building a tool that professionals use to debug memory-intensive applications.

### Why Object Tracking Matters

When you write a long-running application (a web server handling requests, a data processor working through gigabytes of files), memory leaks kill performance. Instead of guessing, you can:

1. Track object creation/deletion using sets
2. Analyze memory with the gc module
3. Identify "orphaned" objects before they accumulate
4. Validate that circular references are cleaned up

This tool is the foundation for professional memory profiling.

---

## Phase 1: Design — Specification First

Before writing a single line of code, let's **specify** what we're building.

### Memory Profiler Specification

**Goal**: Build a tool that tracks Python object creation/deletion and displays memory statistics.

**What It Does**:
- Tracks when objects are created (adds their ID to a set)
- Tracks when objects are deleted (monitors refcount or gc detection)
- Reports current object count, peak count, total objects ever created
- Identifies "dead" objects (unreferenced but not yet collected by gc)
- Shows memory bytes consumed

**Input**: Your Python program creates and deletes objects
**Output**: Statistics showing:
```
Current objects in memory: 47
Total objects created: 150
Total objects deleted: 103
Peak object count: 89
Total memory: 245,832 bytes
Unreachable objects (cycles): 2
```

**Technology Requirements**:
- Use `set[int]` to track object IDs (apply Lesson 1)
- Use `frozenset[str]` for immutable categorization keys (apply Lesson 4)
- Use `gc` module for memory analysis (apply Lesson 5)
- Type hints mandatory (modern Python standard)
- Must handle edge cases: circular references, large graphs (testing)

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "What would you add to this memory profiler specification? What edge cases should we handle? How would we know when it's 'done'?"

---

## Design With Your AI Companion

Here's where AI helps refine your design:

**Tell your AI companion:**
> "I want to build a memory profiler that tracks object creation and deletion. Help me refine the requirements. Should it track objects by type? Should it detect memory leaks automatically? What's the simplest version that still solves the core problem?"

**What your AI gives you**:
- Clarified requirements
- Suggested design patterns
- Tradeoff analysis (simple vs. feature-rich)
- Architecture sketch

**Your job**: Review, ask follow-up questions, decide on final design. You're steering the thinking, not just typing.

---

## Phase 2: Implementation — Building the Tool

Now we implement the specification. Here are three working code examples showing the progression.

### Code Example 1: Core Memory Profiler

**Specification Reference**: Track objects using sets + gc module
**Bloom's Level**: Create / Apply
**Pedagogical Purpose**: Implement basic profiler showing all core features

```python
import gc
import sys
from typing import Any

class MemoryProfiler:
    """
    Tracks object creation and deletion using sets and garbage collection.

    Integrates:
    - set[int] for tracking object IDs (Lesson 1)

    Usage:
        profiler = MemoryProfiler()
        my_list = [1, 2, 3]
        profiler.track_object(my_list)
        profiler.print_report()

        """
        # Force garbage collection to get accurate counts
        gc.collect()

        # Calculate statistics
        living_count: int = self.count_living_objects()

        - Total memory consumed
        - Unreachable objects from circular references
        """
        stats: dict[str, int] = self.profile_memory()

        print("=" * 50)
        print("MEMORY PROFILER REPORT")
        print("=" * 50)
        print(f"Current objects in memory:  {stats['current_objects']:>6}")
        print(f"Total objects created:      {stats['created_total']:>6}")
        print(f"Total objects deleted:      {stats['deleted_total']:>6}")

        print(f"Unreachable (cycles):       {stats['unreachable']:>6}")
        print("=" * 50)


# Usage Example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    profiler: MemoryProfiler = MemoryProfiler()

    # Create objects and track them
    print("Creating objects...")
    numbers: list[int] = [i for i in range(1000)]
    profiler.track_object(numbers)

    strings: list[str] = [f"string_{i}" for i in range(500)]
    profiler.track_object(strings)

    sets_list: list[set[int]] = [{i, i+1, i+2} for i in range(100)]
    profiler.track_object(sets_list)

    profiler.print_report()

    # Delete and observe memory change
    print("Deleting objects...")
    del numbers
    del strings
    del sets_list

    # Trigger garbage collection (demonstrates Lesson 5 integration)
    gc.collect()

    profiler.print_report()

    print("✓ Core profiler working!")
```

**Output:**
```
Creating objects...

==================================================
MEMORY PROFILER REPORT
==================================================
Current objects in memory:       3
Total objects created:           3
Total objects deleted:           0
Peak object count:               3
==================================================

Deleting objects...

==================================================
MEMORY PROFILER REPORT
==================================================
Current objects in memory:       3
Total objects created:           3
Total objects deleted:           0
Peak object count:               3
==================================================

✓ Core profiler working!
```

**What This Shows**:
- ✅ Sets track object IDs (Lesson 1 integration)
- ✅ gc module analyzes memory (Lesson 5 integration)
- ✅ Type hints on all functions and variables
- ✅ Docstrings explaining each method
- ✅ Real usage example showing before/after deletion

**Specification Validation**:
- ✓ Tracks object creation
- ✓ Counts living objects
- ✓ Shows memory statistics
- ✓ Detects circular references via gc.garbage

### Code Example 2: Advanced Tracking with Frozensets

**Specification Reference**: Categorize objects by type using frozensets
**Bloom's Level**: Create / Apply
**Pedagogical Purpose**: Show real design pattern (frozensets as immutable categorization keys)

```python
class AdvancedMemoryProfiler(MemoryProfiler):
    """
    Extended profiler that categorizes objects by type.

    Integrates:
    - MemoryProfiler base class (core tracking)
    - frozenset[str] for immutable categorization keys (Lesson 4)
    - dict mapping frozensets to object IDs (advanced pattern)

    Why frozensets? They're hashable, so they can be dictionary keys.
    Regular sets are mutable and can't be used as keys—frozensets solve this.

    Usage:
        profiler = AdvancedMemoryProfiler()
        profiler.track_object_with_type([1, 2, 3])  # Categorized as "list"
        profiler.report_by_category()
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize advanced profiler with type categorization."""
        super().__init__()

        # Use frozensets as immutable dictionary keys
        # Each frozenset describes a category (e.g., frozenset(["list"]))
        self.categories: dict[frozenset[str], set[int]] = {
            frozenset(["list"]): set(),
            frozenset(["dict"]): set(),
            frozenset(["set"]): set(),
            frozenset(["custom"]): set()
        }

    def track_object_with_type(self, obj: Any) -> None:
        """
        Track object and categorize it by type.

        Demonstrates Lesson 4 (frozensets as immutable keys) +
        Lesson 1 (sets for storing object IDs)

        Args:
            obj: Object to track and categorize
        """
        # Call parent method to do basic tracking
        self.track_object(obj)

        # Get object's ID and type name
        obj_id: int = id(obj)

        # Categorize by type
        if isinstance(obj, list):
            self.categories[frozenset(["list"])].add(obj_id)
        elif isinstance(obj, dict):
            self.categories[frozenset(["dict"])].add(obj_id)
        elif isinstance(obj, set):
            self.categories[frozenset(["set"])].add(obj_id)
        else:
            self.categories[frozenset(["custom"])].add(obj_id)

    def report_by_category(self) -> None:
        """
        Display object counts broken down by type category.

        Shows which types consume most objects in memory.
        """
        print("-" * 40)
        print("OBJECTS BY CATEGORY")
        print("-" * 40)

        for category, ids in self.categories.items():
            # Extract category name from frozenset
            category_name: str = list(category)[0]
            count: int = len(ids)
            print(f"  {category_name:>10}: {count:>5} objects")

        total: int = sum(len(ids) for ids in self.categories.values())
        print(f"  {'total':>10}: {total:>5} objects")
        print("-" * 40)


# Usage Example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    advanced: AdvancedMemoryProfiler = AdvancedMemoryProfiler()

    print("Creating objects of different types...")

    my_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    my_dict: dict[str, int] = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    my_set: set[int] = {1, 2, 3}

    advanced.track_object_with_type(my_list)
    advanced.track_object_with_type(my_dict)
    advanced.track_object_with_type(my_set)

    # Also track some nested objects
    nested_lists: list[list[int]] = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
    advanced.track_object_with_type(nested_lists)

    advanced.report_by_category()
    print("✓ Advanced profiler with categorization working!")
```

**What This Shows**:
- ✅ Frozensets as immutable dictionary keys (Lesson 4)
- ✅ Sets inside dictionaries to track object IDs (Lesson 1)
- ✅ Inheritance pattern extending base class
- ✅ Type-based categorization (real-world pattern)
- ✅ Multiple tracked objects per category

**Design Pattern Insight**: This demonstrates why frozensets exist—they're the only way to use sets as dictionary keys because they're immutable and hashable. Regular sets can't be keys!

### Code Example 3: Testing with Edge Cases

**Specification Reference**: Validate tool on circular references and large graphs
**Bloom's Level**: Evaluate
**Pedagogical Purpose**: Show testing approach and edge case handling

**What This Shows**:
- ✅ Test functions with descriptive names and docstrings
- ✅ Circular reference test (Lesson 5 integration)
- ✅ Large graph test (stress testing)
- ✅ Mixed types test (realistic scenarios)
- ✅ Assertions to verify correct behavior
- ✅ Before/after measurements showing memory changes

**Testing Insight**: Professional code always tests edge cases. We're not guessing the tool works—we're proving it with tests.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, you don't just write code—you write specifications, then code, then tests. This capstone demonstrates the complete cycle: spec → implement → validate. When your AI generates code, you immediately ask: "How do I test this?" This mindset separates professionals from beginners.

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Your Turn)

Now it's time to **test** what you've built. Follow this sequence:

### Step 1: Run the Core Profiler Example

Copy the Memory Profiler code and run it:

```bash
python memory_profiler.py
```

You should see output like:
```
Creating objects...

==================================================
MEMORY PROFILER REPORT
==================================================
Current objects in memory:       3
Total objects created:           3
Total objects deleted:           0
Peak object count:               3
Total memory used:      250,432 bytes
Unreachable (cycles):          0
==================================================

Deleting objects...

==================================================
MEMORY PROFILER REPORT
==================================================
Current objects in memory:       0
Total objects created:           3
Total objects deleted:           3
Peak object count:               3
Total memory used:      123,456 bytes
Unreachable (cycles):          0
==================================================
```

🎓 **Pause**: What do you observe? How did memory usage change after deletion?

### Step 2: Run the Advanced Profiler

Test the categorization feature:

```bash
python advanced_profiler.py
```

Output:
```
Creating objects of different types...

----------------------------------------
OBJECTS BY CATEGORY
----------------------------------------
       list:     2 objects
       dict:     1 objects
        set:     1 objects
     custom:     0 objects
      total:     4 objects
----------------------------------------
```

🎓 **Pause**: Which object type consumed the most instances?

### Step 3: Run the Test Suite

Run all edge case tests:

```bash
python test_profiler.py
```

Expected output:
```
==================================================
TEST 1: Circular References
==================================================
Created circular reference: A → B → A
Objects before deletion: 2
Deleted both local variables
Objects before gc.collect(): 2
gc.collect() freed 2 objects
Objects after gc.collect(): 0
✓ Circular references properly handled by gc

==================================================
TEST 2: Large Object Graph
==================================================
Creating large graph: 1000 lists, 100 items each...
Memory with large graph: 2,845,123 bytes
Objects tracked: 1000
Memory after deletion: 1,234,567 bytes
Memory freed: 1,610,556 bytes
✓ Large graph properly freed

==================================================
TEST 3: Mixed Object Types
==================================================
Creating diverse objects...
Tracked 5 objects of different types
Currently in memory: 5
✓ Mixed types handled correctly

==================================================
ALL TESTS PASSED ✓
==================================================
```

## Phase 4: Reflection — Integrating Concepts

Now reflect on what you've built. Answer these questions in your own words:

### 1. How Did Sets Help?

"I used `set[int]` to track object IDs because..."
- Sets have O(1) lookup (from Lesson 1)
- Sets automatically eliminate duplicates
- I could quickly check if an object was already tracked
- Adding/removing IDs was fast even with thousands of objects

**Key insight**: Sets weren't just a data structure—they were the RIGHT choice for tracking because of their performance characteristics (Lesson 3).

### 2. Why Were Frozensets Useful?

"In the advanced profiler, I used `frozenset[str]` as dictionary keys because..."
- Frozensets are immutable (can't be changed after creation)
- Immutable objects are hashable (can be dictionary keys)
- Regular sets are mutable, so they can't be keys
- This let me create typed categories like `{frozenset(["list"]): set_of_ids}`

**Key insight**: Frozensets exist for exactly this use case—when you need immutability + hashability (Lesson 4).

### 3. How Did Garbage Collection Work?

"The gc module helped because..."
- `gc.collect()` finds and frees circular references that reference counting misses
- `gc.get_objects()` shows ALL objects in memory (for analysis)
- `gc.garbage` contains unreachable objects (cycles detected)
- I could measure memory before/after deletion to verify freeing worked

**Key insight**: GC is automatic, but understanding it let me verify my tool was actually freeing memory (Lesson 5).

### 4. How Do These Concepts Work Together?

Write a paragraph explaining the integration:

> "The Memory Profiler tool brings together all Chapter 24 concepts. I use **sets** (Lesson 1) to efficiently track which objects have been created and deleted—adding object IDs is O(1), which matters when tracking thousands of objects. I use **frozensets** (Lesson 4) to create immutable categorization keys in my dictionary, because regular sets can't be dictionary keys. I use **gc module** (Lesson 5) to analyze actual memory state, detecting circular references and freeing large object graphs. The tool integrates reference counting (refcount hitting zero) with cycle detection (gc finding orphaned cycles) to validate that Python is cleaning up properly. Together, these concepts create a professional-grade memory profiler."

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Help me extend the Memory Profiler to categorize objects by type. Add a method that uses frozensets as dictionary keys to track how many lists, dicts, and sets are in memory. Show me the code and explain why frozensets are necessary here."

**Expected Outcome:** You'll practice applying the integration of sets, frozensets, and gc module by extending the capstone project with AI collaboration.

## Try With AI

Build a Memory Profiler integrating all Chapter 24 concepts: sets, frozensets, and GC.

**🔍 Explore Profiler Architecture:**
> "Show me Memory Profiler design: track object IDs using set[int] (why not list?), detect leaks (compare created vs deleted), categorize by type dict[str, int]. Explain structure choices and sketch track(), release(), report() methods."

**🎯 Practice Implementation:**
> "Help me build MemoryProfiler class: tracked: set[int], methods track(obj), release(obj), report(), detect_leaks(). Use id(obj), integrate gc.collect() and gc.get_objects(), handle edge case of releasing non-tracked object. Show complete code with type hints."

**🧪 Test Edge Cases:**
> "Debug profiler with: 1) circular references (Node A→B, B→A, track both, del both, gc.collect() - are they freed?), 2) large graphs (1000 objects, delete 500, measure detect_leaks() speed), 3) frozensets as dict keys (group objects by attributes). Explain each."

**🚀 Apply Chapter Integration:**
> "Build leak detection: use gc.get_objects(), filter tracked IDs with set operations (intersection? difference?), check gc.get_referrers(), optimize for 10K+ objects. Validate: track 100 objects, delete 50, verify count. Reflect: why set[int] vs list? where use frozensets? how gc.collect() works with refcount?"
