# Understanding Set Internals — Hashing and O(1) Lookup

You've learned how to create sets, modify them, and perform operations. Now comes the crucial question: **Why are sets so fast?** 💬

When you check `999_999 in my_set` with a million elements, Python doesn't loop through each one. It doesn't take a million comparisons. It takes roughly one. This seems like magic—but it's actually one of computer science's most elegant ideas: **hashing**.

In this lesson, you'll understand the mechanism that makes sets powerful. You don't need to implement it yourself, but understanding *why* sets are fast will completely change how you think about data structure choices.

Let's start with a simple question: How does Python find things so quickly?

## Concept: What Are Hash Functions?

Imagine you're designing a library. If you want to find a book, would you:

- **Option A**: Search through every shelf until you find it (O(n) — slow)
- **Option B**: Have a system where the book's ISBN tells you exactly which shelf it's on (O(1) — instant)

Hash functions are Option B for Python data. They're functions that take an object and return an integer—like a locker number. That integer tells Python exactly where to find the object in memory. 🎯

### Python's `hash()` Function

Let's see hash functions in action:

```python
# Hash functions convert objects to integers
print(f"hash(42): {hash(42)}")                  # Some large integer
print(f"hash('hello'): {hash('hello')}")        # Some large integer
print(f"hash((1, 2)): {hash((1, 2))}")          # Some large integer

# Same object = same hash (deterministic within session)
name: str = "Alice"
print(f"First hash: {hash(name)}")              # Example: -5614721507423326267
print(f"Second hash: {hash(name)}")             # Same! -5614721507423326267

# But mutable objects DON'T have hashes
try:
    print(f"hash([1, 2, 3]): {hash([1, 2, 3])}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'list'

try:
    print(f"hash({{'a': 1}}): {hash({'a': 1})}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'dict'
```

**What's happening here?**

- `hash(42)` returns an integer that's always the same for 42
- `hash('hello')` returns an integer that's always the same for "hello"
- Lists and dicts have no hash—they can't reliably be converted to integers

This is the first key insight: **Hash functions are deterministic. The same object always hashes to the same value.**

But notice the error message for lists and dicts. Why can't they be hashed? That's coming next.

## Concept: Why Immutability Matters

Here's where it gets interesting. Imagine Python *could* hash lists. Watch what breaks:

```python
# If lists could be hashed (which they can't)...
# Original list: [1, 2, 3]
# hash([1, 2, 3]) = 12345  <- Python stores it at slot 12345

# Then you modify the list: [1, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 4]
# hash([1, 2, 4]) = 54321  <- Now it wants slot 54321
# But Python still looks in slot 12345!
# Result: The element "disappears" even though it still exists

# This is why Python prevents it:
try:
    bad_set: set = {[1, 2]}  # Can't do this
except TypeError:
    print("❌ Lists aren't hashable because they're mutable")

# Tuples ARE hashable because they're immutable
coords: set[tuple[int, int]] = {(1, 2), (3, 4)}
print(f"✓ Tuples work: {coords}")

# If a tuple could change, it would break lookups the same way
# Since tuples CAN'T change, their hash is forever stable
```

**The core constraint**: Hash values must be stable. If an object's hash changes after being added to a set, lookups break. **Only immutable objects have stable hashes.**

This is why:
- ✅ Tuples are hashable (immutable)
- ✅ Strings are hashable (immutable)
- ✅ Numbers are hashable (immutable)
- ✅ Frozensets are hashable (immutable)
- ❌ Lists are NOT hashable (mutable)
- ❌ Dicts are NOT hashable (mutable)
- ❌ Sets are NOT hashable (mutable)

**Practical impact**: Dict keys must be immutable, set elements must be immutable. This constraint exists for mathematical correctness, not arbitrary rules.

## Concept: Performance Comparison — O(1) vs. O(n)

Here's why this all matters. Let's see the real performance difference:

```python
import time

# Create a large list and set with the same hundred thousand elements
elements: list[int] = list(range(100_000))
element_set: set[int] = set(elements)

# Test: Find if 99_999 exists
target: int = 99_999

# SET LOOKUP (O(1) average case)
start = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000):
    result_set = target in element_set
end = time.perf_counter()
set_time = end - start

# LIST LOOKUP (O(n) — must check elements until found)
start = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000):
    result_list = target in elements  # Might find it last!
end = time.perf_counter()
list_time = end - start

print(f"Set lookup time: {set_time:.6f} seconds")    # Very fast (microseconds)
print(f"List lookup time: {list_time:.6f} seconds")  # Much slower (milliseconds)
print(f"Set is {list_time / set_time:.0f}x faster")  # Often 1000x+ faster
```
**What's happening?**

- **Set lookup**: Uses hash to jump directly to element's location. One comparison. O(1).
- **List lookup**: Starts at position 0, checks each element. 99,999 comparisons. O(n).

With 100,000 elements, that's the difference between "instant" and "takes time you can see."

This is why sets matter: **They scale differently than lists.** As data grows, set performance stays fast while list performance gets slower.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, you don't memorize Big-O notation—you understand the pattern. When you see "checking if X exists in a large collection," that's your cue to use a set. Ask your AI: "Should this be a list or a set?" and it'll explain the performance implications for your specific use case.

## Concept: Hash Tables Conceptually

Let's understand the internal structure without diving into CPython implementation details.

A **hash table** is just an array (like a list of slots). When you add an element to a set:

1. Python calls `hash(element)` to get an integer
2. Python uses that integer (modulo array size) to find a slot
3. Python stores the element in that slot
4. When you look for the element, Python does the same calculation and finds it instantly

Here's a simplified illustration:

```python
# Imagine a hash table with 10 slots (index 0-9)
# We'll store the numbers [1, 11, 21]

# hash(1) % 10 = 1     -> stores at slot 1
# hash(11) % 10 = 1    -> wants slot 1 (COLLISION!)
# hash(21) % 10 = 1    -> wants slot 1 (COLLISION!)

# Python handles collisions by chaining (storing multiple items per slot)
# or probing (finding the next available slot)

# When you ask: "Is 11 in the set?"
# Python calculates hash(11) % 10 = 1
# Goes to slot 1, finds 11 (or checks if it's there)
# Result: Fast lookup even with collisions!

# The key insight: O(1) is "average case"
# Worst case (everything collides) is O(n), but that's extremely rare
```

**Rehashing** happens automatically. As you add more elements to a set, Python occasionally resizes the underlying hash table to keep collisions minimal:

```python
my_set: set[int] = set()

# Python internally resizes the hash table as you add elements
# You don't see this happening, but it's optimizing behind the scenes
for i in range(1_000_000):
    my_set.add(i)

print(f"Set with 1M elements created successfully")  # Works seamlessly
print(f"Final set size: {len(my_set)}")              # 1,000,000

# Rehashing is efficient; Python doesn't do it on every add
# It resizes when load factor (elements/slots) gets too high
```

**Why does this matter?** Understanding that sets use hash tables helps you predict their behavior:
- Adding elements: O(1) average case
- Removing elements: O(1) average case
- Checking membership: O(1) average case
- Performance is consistent and predictable

## Code Example: Why Immutability is Required (Full Context)

Now let's tie this together with a concrete example showing why immutability is foundational:

**SPECIFICATION REFERENCE**: Chapter 24, Lesson 3, Functional Requirements FR-014

**AI PROMPTS USED**:
1. "Explain why lists can't be in sets with an example showing what would break"
2. "Show me what types CAN be dict keys and why"

**CODE EXAMPLE**:

```python
# Hashable immutable types work as dict keys
valid_dict_1: dict[int, str] = {1: "a", 2: "b"}
valid_dict_2: dict[tuple[int, int], str] = {(1, 2): "position", (3, 4): "corner"}
valid_dict_3: dict[frozenset[int], str] = {
    frozenset([1, 2]): "group_a",
    frozenset([3, 4]): "group_b"
}

print(f"✓ All valid dict keys created")

# Unhashable mutable types fail
try:
    invalid_dict: dict[list[int], str] = {[1, 2]: "position"}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'list'

try:
    invalid_dict: dict[dict[str, int], str] = {{"a": 1}: "config"}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'dict'

# Why? If you could use a list as key:
# You could later modify it: [1, 2] -> [1, 3]
# The dict lookup would break because the key changed
# This violates the fundamental contract of dictionaries
```

**VALIDATION STEPS**:
1. Run code and observe which types work as dict keys
2. Predict which types will fail before running
3. Connect the error to the immutability principle
4. Explain: "Dict keys must be immutable because their hash must never change"

## Concept: Real-World Performance Decision

Here's where this theory becomes practice. Let's say you're building a user authentication system:

```python
# SCENARIO: Check if a user ID exists in the database

# BAD APPROACH: Using a list (O(n) lookup)
def is_user_in_list(user_id: int, user_database: list[int]) -> bool:
    return user_id in user_database  # Slow for large databases
    # With 100K users, this is 50K comparisons on average

# GOOD APPROACH: Using a set (O(1) lookup)
def is_user_in_set(user_id: int, user_database: set[int]) -> bool:
    return user_id in user_database  # Fast for large databases
    # With 100K users, this is ~1 comparison always

# Real performance test
database_list: list[int] = list(range(100_000))
database_set: set[int] = set(range(100_000))

import time

# Test multiple lookups to get measurable time
start = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(1000):
    found = 99_999 in database_list
list_time = time.perf_counter() - start

start = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(1000):
    found = 99_999 in database_set
set_time = time.perf_counter() - start

print(f"List lookup: {list_time*1000:.3f}ms")  # Noticeable delay
print(f"Set lookup: {set_time*1000:.3f}ms")    # Instant
if set_time > 0:
    print(f"Set is {list_time/set_time:.0f}x faster")
else:
    print("Set is extremely fast (too fast to measure accurately)")

# Practical insight:
# If you're checking membership frequently (logins, permissions, caching),
# use a set. The performance difference is dramatic at scale.
```

**Decision Framework**:
- **Use list** when: Order matters, duplicates allowed, few lookups
- **Use set** when: Order doesn't matter, uniqueness required, many lookups needed
- **Use dict** when: You need key-value pairs

This decision—seemingly small—has massive implications at scale.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I'm building a user authentication system that checks if a user ID exists in a database of 1 million users, thousands of times per second. Should I store user IDs in a list or a set? Generate a performance comparison showing why your choice matters."

**Expected Outcome:** You'll see concrete performance numbers demonstrating O(n) vs. O(1) lookup and understand why data structure choice is critical for production systems.

## Practice Exercises

Now it's your turn. Try these exercises to solidify your understanding:

**Exercise 1: Hash Values and Patterns**
```python
# Call hash() on different immutable objects
# Observe: Do similar objects have similar hashes?
# Do the same objects always hash to the same value?

numbers: list[int] = [1, 10, 100, 1000]
for num in numbers:
    print(f"hash({num}): {hash(num)}")

strings: list[str] = ["apple", "apple", "banana"]
for s in strings:
    print(f"hash({s}): {hash(s)}")

# Question: Why might hash(1000) be very different from hash(1)?
# (Hint: It's not "bigger hash for bigger number"—it's designed to spread
```

**Exercise 2: Hashability Verification**
```python
# Create a mixed set of hashable objects
# Then try to add unhashable objects and catch the error

try:
    mixed_set: set = {1, "hello", (2, 3), 3.14, True}
    print(f"✓ Hashable set created: {mixed_set}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")

try:
    bad_set: set = {[1, 2], "hello"}  # Lists aren't hashable
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"❌ Expected error: {e}")

# Question: Why does int work but list doesn't?
```

**Exercise 3: Performance Comparison with Your Own Data**
```python
import time

# Create test data
sizes: list[int] = [1_000, 10_000, 50_000]

for size in sizes:
    test_list: list[int] = list(range(size))
    test_set: set[int] = set(range(size))

    target: int = size - 1  # Last element (worst case for list)

    # Time list lookup
    start = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(1000):
        _ = target in test_list
    list_time = time.perf_counter() - start

    # Time set lookup
    start = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(1000):
        _ = target in test_set
    set_time = time.perf_counter() - start

    if set_time > 0:
        print(f"Size {size:,}: Set is {list_time/set_time:.0f}x faster")
    else:
        print(f"Size {size:,}: Set is extremely fast")

# Question: Does the speedup increase as size grows?
```

**Exercise 4: Design Decision Scenario**
```python
# You're building a social media app that tracks which users
# follow which other users. You need to check "does user A follow user B?"
# thousands of times per second.

# Option A: Store followers as a list
followers_list: list[int] = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]  # User IDs

# Option B: Store followers as a set
followers_set: set[int] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}

# Question: Which would you choose?
# Why? What if you had millions of followers?
# What if you needed to check "who follows user B?" (iterate all followers)
```

Take your time with these. The goal isn't to memorize hash functions—it's to understand the *why* behind set's speed and make informed data structure choices. 🎯
