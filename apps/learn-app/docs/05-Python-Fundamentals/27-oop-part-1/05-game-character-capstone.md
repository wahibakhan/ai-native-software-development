# Task and TaskManager Classes (Capstone)

Every application manages collections of things: inventory items, user profiles, support tickets, or todo tasks. This capstone teaches you how professionals structure such systems using OOP. Instead of manually typing 200+ lines of code, you'll work at a higher level: **planning the architecture with AI, having it generate code, then validating and extending the design**. This mirrors how production systems are built.

**Key shift**: You focus on design decisions and validation. AI handles typing and syntax details.

---

## Part 1: Plan Task System Architecture with AI

**Your Role**: System designer collaborating with AI to plan (not write formal specs - just plain language design thinking)

### Planning Exercise: Design Your Task Management System

You'll have a **design conversation** with AI about what you want to build. No formal specs - just system design thinking.

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Initial System Design

> "I want to build a todo task management system. Help me think through the design (don't write code yet, just help me plan):
>
> **What I want:**
> - Task items that track title, description, priority, and completion status
> - A TaskManager that stores multiple tasks and lets me search by title
> - Tasks should validate that priority stays between 1-10
> - Mark tasks complete and update priorities
> - Get a readable string representation of tasks
>
> **Help me decide:**
> 1. Should I have a Task class for individual items and a separate TaskManager class? Why?
> 2. How do I prevent invalid priority values (negative, over 10)?
> 3. What methods should Task have? (create, complete, modify priority, display)
> 4. What methods should TaskManager have? (add, find, list, maybe filter by priority)
> 5. How should tasks display themselves as text?
> 6. How should I structure this so I can extend it later (recurring tasks, due dates)?
>
> Give me a simple design plan with class structure and responsibilities. Use plain language, not technical jargon."

**Expected AI Output**: A plain-language plan explaining:
- Task class = individual todo item with validation
- TaskManager class = container managing multiple tasks (composition)
- Methods for both classes with clear responsibilities
- Validation strategy (properties or validation in methods)
- Design rationale in simple terms

**Your task**: Read AI's plan. Does the design make sense? Can you visualize how the classes work together? What questions do you have?

---

### Challenge AI's Design with "What If" Scenarios

Now test if AI thought through edge cases:

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Edge Case Planning

> "I like your plan, but I need to think through some real-world scenarios:
>
> **Scenario 1**: Someone tries to create a Task with priority 15. What should happen?
> **Scenario 2**: User marks a task complete, then wants to unmark it later. How should that work?
> **Scenario 3**: User searches for a task with title "Buy Milk" but all titles are case-sensitive. What if they search "buy milk"? Exact match only or fuzzy?
> **Scenario 4**: Two tasks have the same title. Should find_by_title return the first match, all matches, or raise an error?
> **Scenario 5**: TaskManager is empty. What should list_tasks() return?
>
> For each, explain what makes sense from a user perspective. How should my design handle these cases?"

**Expected Learning**: AI will explain design patterns (validation with exceptions, stateful properties, case-insensitive search, defensive programming). You're learning **design thinking**, not just coding syntax.

---

### Your Simple Design Plan

After your conversation with AI, write down a simple plan:

**My Task System Design Notes:**
- Task class = individual todo item
  - title (required, non-empty)
  - description (optional)
  - priority (1-10, defaults to 5)
  - status ("pending" or "completed")
  - done (True/False boolean)
  - Methods: mark_complete(), update_priority(new_priority)
  - Methods: __repr__() for display, __eq__() for comparison

- TaskManager class = manages multiple Task objects
  - tasks list (collection of Task instances)
  - Methods: add_task(task), list_tasks(), find_by_title(title)
  - Methods: remove_task(task), maybe filter_by_priority(priority)

- Validation:
  - Priority must be 1-10 (enforce in update_priority method)
  - Title can't be empty
  - Status/done track completion state

- Design principles:
  - Task HAS-A data (title, priority, etc.)
  - TaskManager HAS-A collection of Tasks (composition)
  - Methods modify state safely (encapsulation)

**Key Learning**: You planned the ARCHITECTURE through conversation, not by writing formal specs. That skill comes later in Part 5.

**Deliverable**: Simple task system design notes from your AI conversation. You've planned the architecture - now AI will help generate the implementation.

---

## Part 2: Generate Code and Validate Design

**Your Role**: Design validator working with AI to generate and refine the system

### AI-Assisted Implementation

Instead of typing 200+ lines manually, you'll have AI generate the system, then YOU validate it against your design plan.

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Generate Task and TaskManager Classes

> "Based on my task management design plan, generate the complete Python code:
>
> **Task Class Requirements:**
> - Attributes: title (str), description (str, default ""), priority (int, default 5), status (str, default "pending"), done (bool, default False), due_date (optional)
> - Constructor: __init__(self, title: str, description: str = "", priority: int = 5)
> - Methods:
>   - mark_complete() → sets done to True, status to "completed"
>   - update_priority(new_priority: int) → validates 1-10, raises ValueError if invalid
>   - __repr__() → returns readable string like "[✓] Buy milk (P2)" or "[○] Buy milk (P2)"
>   - __eq__(other) → compares tasks by title
> - Use type hints on all methods
> - Use docstrings for all methods
>
> **TaskManager Class Requirements:**
> - Attributes: tasks (list of Task objects, empty initially)
> - Methods:
>   - add_task(task: Task) → adds task to list
>   - list_tasks() → returns copy of tasks list
>   - find_by_title(title: str) → returns Task if found, None otherwise
>   - remove_task(task: Task) → removes from list, returns True if found
>   - count_completed() → returns number of done tasks
> - Use type hints and docstrings
>
> Generate complete working code. I'll validate it against my design."

**Expected AI Output**: ~80-120 lines of complete code implementing both classes.

---

### Validation Exercise: Check AI's Implementation

**Your task**: Read the AI-generated code and validate these design decisions:

**✅ Validation Checklist:**

1. **Class Structure**:
   - Does Task have all required attributes? ✓
   - Does Task have all required methods? ✓
   - Does TaskManager exist as separate class? ✓
   - Is TaskManager's tasks list initialized as empty list? ✓

2. **Encapsulation (Lesson 4 concept)**:
   - Does update_priority validate that 1 is less than or equal to priority and priority is less than or equal to 10? ✓
   - Does update_priority raise ValueError with clear message? ✓
   - Does mark_complete set both done and status correctly? ✓

3. **String Representation**:
   - Does __repr__ show meaningful info (title, done status, priority)? ✓
   - Does __repr__ use symbols like ✓ and ○ for visibility? ✓
   - Does __eq__ compare by title (two tasks with same title are equal)? ✓

4. **Type Hints (Chapter 27 standard)**:
   - Does every method have parameter type hints? ✓
   - Does every method have return type hints? ✓
   - Does Task.__eq__ return bool? ✓

5. **TaskManager Composition**:
   - Does TaskManager HAS-A collection of Task objects? ✓
   - Do methods return appropriate types (Task | None, list[Task], bool)? ✓

6. **Edge Cases (from Part 1 planning)**:
   - Does find_by_title return None if not found? ✓
   - Does list_tasks return copy (not reference to internal list)? ✓
   - Does update_priority handle invalid values with exception? ✓

**Expected Learning**: You validate AI's implementation through testing, not by reading every line. Professional workflow = specify → generate → validate.

**Your task**: Write and test the implementation:
- Create Task objects with valid and invalid parameters
- Create TaskManager and add multiple tasks
- Test find_by_title, filter_by_priority, count_completed
- Test edge cases (empty title, invalid priority, nonexistent tasks)
- Document what works and what needs refinement

**Deliverable**: Fully functional task system passing all validation tests.

---

## Part 3: Challenge AI with "What If" Extensions

**Your Role**: System designer testing design flexibility

### Extension Challenge Exercise

Now that you have a working system, challenge AI to extend it. Can the design handle new features without major refactoring?

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Add Recurring Tasks

> "I want to add recurring tasks to my system. Recurring tasks repeat on a schedule (daily, weekly, monthly):
>
> **Requirements:**
> - Recurring task repeats until marked complete or cancelled
> - Has: title, description, priority, recurrence_pattern ('daily', 'weekly', 'monthly')
> - Methods: same as Task, plus next_occurrence() that returns when task recurs
> - When marked complete, should create a new instance for next occurrence
>
> Design options:
> 1. Add recurrence_pattern to Task class (all tasks have it, even if null)?
> 2. Create RecurringTask subclass inheriting from Task?
> 3. Create separate Task and RecurringTask classes both managed by TaskManager?
>
> Which design is better? Show me the code for your recommendation. Explain trade-offs."

**Expected Learning**: AI will show you how to extend your system through inheritance or composition. You'll see if your original design was flexible.

---

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Priority Filtering and Sorting

> "I want to display tasks sorted by priority (highest first). Currently I have filter_by_priority() which returns a list.
>
> **Options:**
> 1. Add get_high_priority_tasks() method returning tasks with priority 1-3?
> 2. Add sort_by_priority() to TaskManager returning sorted list?
> 3. Implement custom comparator for Task so I can use Python's sorted() function?
>
> Which is most Pythonic? Show me code for the best approach. What would production code do?"

**Expected Learning**: AI introduces Python's built-in sorting mechanisms and design patterns for filtering/sorting collections.

---

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Add Due Date Support

> "I want tasks to have due dates and show overdue status:
> - Task has optional due_date (datetime or None)
> - is_overdue() method returns True if done=False and due_date &lt; today
> - TaskManager has get_overdue_tasks() returning tasks past deadline
>
> How should due dates affect priority sorting? Should overdue tasks always sort first? Show me implementation with datetime usage."

**Expected Learning**: You see how object attributes and methods interact with real-world domain concepts (dates, deadlines).

---

### Your Extensions

Implement 1-2 new features with AI assistance:
- Recurring tasks (inheritance approach with RecurringTask subclass)
- Priority-based sorting (custom methods or sorting support)
- Due date support (datetime integration)
- Task templates (create common tasks from patterns)

**Deliverable**: Extended task system with 1-2 new features generated and validated through AI.

---

## Part 4: Build Your OOP Design Framework

**Your Role**: Experienced designer extracting lessons learned

### Reflection Exercise

After building and extending your system with AI, extract the **design patterns** you learned.

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt - Synthesize Design Patterns

> "Based on my Task Management System project, help me create a design guide for future OOP projects:
>
> **What I learned:**
> 1. When to create separate classes vs add attributes to existing class
> 2. When to use composition (TaskManager HAS-A list of Tasks) vs inheritance (RecurringTask IS-A Task)
> 3. How to design for validation and prevent invalid states
> 4. How to use __repr__ and __eq__ for meaningful object behavior
> 5. How to structure classes so they're easy to extend
>
> Give me a framework with:
> - When to use each design pattern
> - Common mistakes to avoid
> - Quick decision guide ('If X, use Y')
> - Examples from my task system
>
> Use my actual project as examples throughout."

**Expected AI Output**: A personalized OOP design guide based on your project experience.

---

### Your OOP Design Framework

Save AI's framework as your reference. Example structure:

**My OOP Design Guide (From Task System Project):**

**Single Responsibility Principle:**
- Task class = manages single task (title, priority, completion, validation)
- TaskManager class = manages collection of tasks (add, find, list, filter)
- Each class has one reason to change

**When to Use Composition (HAS-A):**
- TaskManager HAS-A list of Task objects
- "Does X contain Y?" → Yes, use composition
- Composition is more flexible than inheritance
- Example: RecurringTask HAS-A base Task pattern

**When to Use Inheritance (IS-A):**
- RecurringTask IS-A Task (shares all Task behavior)
- "Is X a specialized version of Y?" → Yes, use inheritance
- Subclasses inherit constructor, methods, validation
- Example: RecurringTask adds recurrence_pattern, next_occurrence()

**String Representation and Comparison:**
- __repr__() makes Task display nicely: "[✓] Title (P5)"
- __eq__() enables "task1 == task2" comparison by meaningful attribute
- Essential for debugging and testing

**Design for Extensibility:**
- Use clear method names and consistent signatures
- Design validation in constructors and methods (update_priority checks range)
- Use type hints so subclasses know expected types
- Composition is often more flexible than inheritance

**Common Mistakes I Avoided:**
- Making everything inherit (sometimes composition is simpler)
- Forgetting validation (prevented invalid states)
- Not planning for extensions (able to add recurring tasks easily)
- Exposing internal data directly (return .copy() for lists)

**Deliverable**: Personal OOP design framework extracted from your project. You've learned by building, not just reading.

---

## Part 5: AI Validation and Professional Polish

**Your Role**: Engineer ensuring production quality

### Final Validation Exercise

Ask AI:

> "Final review: Does my Task Management System demonstrate:
> 1. Proper use of OOP principles (encapsulation, composition, type hints)?
> 2. Professional Python style (naming, docstrings, error handling)?
> 3. Robust validation and edge case handling?
> 4. Clear class responsibilities and method design?
> 5. Extensibility for future features?
>
> Give me a final checklist of what would make this production-ready and how I'm meeting those standards."

---

### Your Final Deliverables

1. **task_system_specification.md** - Full design specification from Part 1
2. **task_manager_system.py** - Complete Task and TaskManager classes
3. **ai_review_feedback.md** - AI's code review and your responses
4. **extended_system.py** - One implemented extension (RecurringTask or DueDate support)
5. **production_checklist.md** - Production-readiness criteria and how you meet them

---

## Real-World Applications

The Task + TaskManager pattern appears everywhere:

**Legal Domain:**
```python
class Case:
    """Legal case with status tracking."""
    def __init__(self, title: str, case_number: str, priority: int = 5):
        self.title = title
        self.case_number = case_number
        self.priority = priority
        self.status = "open"  # Same validation as Task
        self.due_date = None

class CaseManager:
    """Manages law firm's active cases."""
    def find_by_case_number(self, number: str) -> Case | None:
        # Same pattern as TaskManager
        pass
```

**Finance Domain:**
```python
class Invoice:
    """Billing invoice with status and priority."""
    def __init__(self, title: str, amount: float, priority: int = 5):
        self.title = title
        self.amount = amount
        self.priority = priority
        self.status = "pending"  # Same validation pattern

class InvoiceManager:
    """Manages company invoices."""
    def filter_by_status(self, status: str) -> list[Invoice]:
        # Same composition pattern as TaskManager
        pass
```

**Healthcare Domain:**
```python
class Appointment:
    """Medical appointment with scheduling and priority."""
    def __init__(self, title: str, patient_name: str, priority: int = 5):
        self.title = title
        self.patient_name = patient_name
        self.priority = priority
        self.status = "scheduled"

class AppointmentScheduler:
    """Manages clinic's appointments."""
    def find_by_patient(self, name: str) -> list[Appointment]:
        # Same pattern, different domain
        pass
```

**Key Insight**: Once you master the Task + Manager pattern, you can apply it anywhere: Projects + ProjectManager, Tickets + TicketManager, Users + UserManager. This is fundamental OOP architecture.

### Transition to Chapter 29

Objects organize your task data beautifully. Your system is properly structured with clear separation of concerns. In **Chapter 29**, you'll learn about **dataclasses**, which are Python's way of making classes like Task even simpler to define while keeping all the power:

```python
# Chapter 27 (what you built now):
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title: str, description: str = ""):
        self.title = title
        self.description = description

# Chapter 29 (coming soon):
@dataclass
class Task:
    title: str
    description: str = ""  # Same structure, cleaner syntax
```

Same functionality, better syntax. Your understanding of classes and objects is the foundation.

## Try With AI

Ready to design and build a task management system that demonstrates OOP mastery?

**🏗️ Design the Architecture:**
> "I want to build a task management system. Help me design: should I have a Task class for individual items and a TaskManager class for the collection? What methods does each need? What validation should prevent invalid tasks? Draw me a simple class diagram or structure."

**What you're learning:** Architectural thinking - how to organize classes and their relationships before writing code. This is how professionals approach OOP projects.

---

**💻 Build the Foundation:**
> "Build me a Task class with: title (required), description (optional), priority (1-10, defaults to 5), and done status (boolean). Include an __init__ method, a mark_complete() method, and a __repr__() that shows '[✓] Title (P5)' or '[○] Title (P5)'. Use type hints and validation in update_priority() method. Show test code creating two tasks and marking one complete."

**What you're learning:** Class structure with proper initialization, validation, and methods that safely modify state. This is encapsulation in practice.

---

**🔍 Extend the System:**
> "Add a TaskManager class that manages a collection of Task objects. Include: add_task(task), list_tasks(), find_by_title(title) returning Task or None, count_completed() showing how many tasks are done. Show me code that creates a TaskManager, adds 3 tasks, finds one by title, marks it complete, and shows the count."

**What you're learning:** Composition pattern - TaskManager HAS-A collection of Task objects. This shows how real systems are built from interacting classes.

---

**⚙️ Validate Design Decisions:**
> "Test my Task system for edge cases: (1) Creating task with empty title should fail, (2) Priority 15 should raise error, (3) Two tasks with same title should be equal (task1 == task2), (4) Marking complete should set both done=True and status='completed'. Show me test code and expected outputs."

**What you're learning:** Design validation through testing. Professional workflow = design → generate → test → refine.

---

**🚀 Plan an Extension:**
> "I want to add a RecurringTask that repeats daily/weekly/monthly. Should RecurringTask inherit from Task or be separate? What new methods does it need? How does TaskManager handle both regular and recurring tasks? Show me a design comparison of inheritance vs composition for this feature."

**What you're learning:** Advanced design patterns and trade-offs. How good designs remain flexible when requirements change.
