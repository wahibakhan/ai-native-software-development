    {
      question: "You're building a banking system and need 1,000 account objects. What's the core advantage of OOP over procedural programming for this scenario?",
      options: [
        "Define account logic once, create 1,000 independent instances automatically",
        "OOP runs faster than procedural code for large datasets",
        "Classes use less memory than separate variables and functions",
        "OOP prevents bugs that procedural programming cannot catch"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. OOP's core advantage is defining the blueprint (class) once and creating as many independent instances as needed. With procedural code, you'd need 1,000 sets of variables and duplicate functions. OOP doesn't inherently run faster (option 2), use less memory (option 3), or prevent all bugs (option 4)—its power lies in code reusability and organization through the class-instance pattern. When describing this to AI, you'd say 'create a BankAccount class with balance and deposit/withdraw methods,' and AI knows one definition serves infinite instances. This is covered in Lesson 1: What is OOP?",
      source: "Lesson 1: What is OOP? Why OOP?"
    },
    {
      question: "What problem does Object-Oriented Programming primarily solve compared to procedural programming?",
      options: [
        "Scaling and organizing code for multiple similar entities",
        "Making programs run significantly faster through optimization",
        "Preventing all possible runtime errors through type safety",
        "Reducing the total lines of code needed"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. OOP solves the scaling and organization problem—when you have many entities (users, products, agents) with similar data and behavior, OOP lets you define structure once and create unlimited instances. Option 2 is wrong (OOP isn't primarily about speed). Option 3 is wrong (OOP doesn't prevent all errors). Option 4 is misleading (OOP can actually increase code for simple tasks). The real power emerges when managing multiple objects: with procedural code, 100 entities = 200+ variables and duplicate functions; with OOP, it's 1 class definition and 100 instances. Lesson 1 demonstrates this through the banking system example.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What is OOP? Why OOP?"
    },
    {
      question: "Which scenario makes OOP the right architectural choice over procedural programming?",
      options: [
        "You have 5+ entities with similar data structure and operations",
        "Your script calculates a mathematical formula with 3 variables",
        "You're writing a one-time data migration script",
        "The program needs to run as fast as possible"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. OOP becomes valuable when you have multiple similar entities that share structure and behavior. This is the decision framework from Lesson 1: if you're managing many instances of the same concept, use OOP. Option 2 (math formula) works fine procedurally. Option 3 (one-time script) doesn't benefit from OOP's reusability. Option 4 (performance) is wrong—OOP vs procedural doesn't inherently determine speed. When working with AI, describing 'multiple similar objects' signals that AI should suggest class-based architecture. The decision tree in Lesson 1 guides this: similar entities + repeated operations + growth potential = use OOP.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What is OOP? Why OOP?"
    },
    {
      question: "In OOP, what are the 'four pillars' that define the paradigm's core principles?",
      options: [
        "Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism",
        "Classes, Objects, Methods, Attributes",
        "Constructors, Destructors, Getters, Setters",
        "Public, Private, Protected, Static"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. The four pillars of OOP are Encapsulation (bundling data and methods), Abstraction (hiding implementation details), Inheritance (reusing code through parent-child relationships), and Polymorphism (different objects responding to same interface). Option 2 lists implementation concepts, not principles. Option 3 lists specific methods. Option 4 lists access modifiers. These four pillars represent design philosophies: Encapsulation protects data, Abstraction simplifies interfaces, Inheritance promotes reuse, Polymorphism enables flexibility. Understanding these helps you describe design intent to AI: 'encapsulate user data' or 'inherit from base agent class.' Lesson 1 introduces these conceptually before diving into implementation in later lessons.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What is OOP? Why OOP?"
    },
    {
      question: "You asked AI to 'create a User class.' What does AI understand this request to mean?",
      options: [
        "Create a blueprint that can produce multiple user objects",
        "Create one user object with specific data",
        "Generate procedural functions for user operations",
        "Create a database schema for user storage"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. When you say 'create a User class,' AI understands you want a blueprint (template) for creating user objects, not a single user instance. The class defines structure (attributes like name, email) and behavior (methods like login, logout). Option 2 confuses class (blueprint) with instance (object). Option 3 would be procedural, not OOP. Option 4 is database design, different domain. This distinction is critical: 'create a class' = define template; 'create an object' = make instance from template. Lesson 2 emphasizes that the class is the cookie cutter, objects are the cookies. Understanding this helps you give precise instructions to AI.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Classes and Objects Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the relationship between a class and an object in Python?",
      options: [
        "Class is the blueprint; object is instance created from it",
        "Class contains objects; objects contain methods",
        "Object is the template; class is the implementation",
        "Class and object are two names for same thing"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. The class is the blueprint or template that defines structure and behavior; the object is a specific instance created from that blueprint. Think: architectural plans (class) vs. actual building (object). Option 2 is backwards. Option 3 reverses the relationship. Option 4 is wrong—they're distinct concepts. You can create unlimited objects from one class, each with independent data: `dog1 = Dog('Max')`, `dog2 = Dog('Buddy')` creates two objects from the Dog class. When collaborating with AI, saying 'create the Dog class' means define the template, while 'create a dog object' means instantiate from that template. Lesson 2 demonstrates this with the cookie cutter analogy.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Classes and Objects Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the `self` parameter represent in a Python instance method?",
      options: [
        "The specific object instance calling the method",
        "The class definition itself, not any instance",
        "A global variable accessible across all methods",
        "The parent class from which this inherits"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. `self` represents 'this specific object'—the instance that called the method. When `dog1.bark()` is called, inside the bark() method, `self` refers to dog1. This is how methods operate on instance-specific data: `self.name` accesses that particular dog's name. Option 2 describes `cls` in class methods. Option 3 is wrong (self is not global). Option 4 describes inheritance, not self. Python requires explicit `self` so you clearly see when you're accessing instance data (`self.balance`) vs. local variables (`amount`). When reviewing AI-generated code, verify that instance methods have `self` as first parameter and use `self.attribute` to access object state. Lesson 2 covers this thoroughly.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Classes and Objects Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "You create two objects: `alice = BankAccount('Alice', 1000)` and `bob = BankAccount('Bob', 500)`. After calling `alice.deposit(200)`, what is bob's balance?",
      options: [
        "500 (unchanged, objects have independent state)",
        "700 (both balances increased by 200)",
        "1200 (bob's balance matches alice's new balance)",
        "Error: cannot modify one object without affecting others"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Each object maintains independent state in its own memory space. When you call `alice.deposit(200)`, only alice's balance changes—bob's remains 500. This is the fundamental power of objects: data isolation. Option 2 suggests objects share state (they don't). Option 3 suggests state synchronization (doesn't happen automatically). Option 4 is completely wrong—object independence is core to OOP. This contrasts with global variables in procedural code, where modifications affect all functions. In AI collaboration, this independence means you can ask AI to 'create 1,000 accounts' and know each operates independently. Lesson 2 demonstrates this through experiments with multiple dog objects.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Classes and Objects Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in a Python class?",
      options: [
        "Automatically initialize object attributes when instance is created",
        "Define which methods the class can access",
        "Specify the class inheritance hierarchy",
        "Delete the object when it goes out of scope"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. `__init__` is the constructor that Python calls automatically when you create an object. It initializes attributes with values: `def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name; self.age = age`. This eliminates the repetition of manually setting attributes on every object. Option 2 is wrong (methods are defined separately). Option 3 is wrong (inheritance uses different syntax). Option 4 describes `__del__`, the destructor. Without `__init__`, you'd write: `dog = Dog(); dog.name = 'Max'; dog.breed = 'Lab'`—repetitive and error-prone. With `__init__`: `dog = Dog('Max', 'Lab')`—concise and enforced. When working with AI, you'd say 'the constructor should accept name and age as required parameters,' and AI generates the `__init__` method. Lesson 2 shows this evolution from manual attribute setting to constructor-based initialization.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Classes and Objects Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does Python require the explicit `self` parameter in instance methods?",
      options: [
        "To clearly distinguish instance data from local variables",
        "Because Python is slower without explicit parameters",
        "To prevent methods from accessing class attributes",
        "Self is optional; it's just a naming convention"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Explicit `self` makes it obvious when you're accessing instance data (`self.balance`) vs. local variables (`amount` in a method). This clarity prevents bugs and makes code readable. Option 2 is wrong (no performance reason). Option 3 is backwards (self enables access, doesn't prevent it). Option 4 is dangerous misinformation—`self` is required, though the name could technically be different (but 'self' is the universal convention). When reviewing AI-generated code, if you see a method accessing attributes without `self.`, that's a bug. This explicit design philosophy appears throughout Python: 'explicit is better than implicit' (Zen of Python). Lesson 2 demonstrates how `self` enables object independence.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Classes and Objects Basics"
    },
    {
      question: "When should a constructor parameter have a default value instead of being required?",
      options: [
        "When the attribute represents optional or convenience data",
        "Always use defaults to make the API flexible",
        "Never use defaults; all data should be explicit",
        "Only when the class has exactly three parameters"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Use defaults for optional, non-critical data (like `age=0` for unknown age, or `role='user'` for typical role). Required parameters force callers to provide critical data (like `name`—every person must have one). Option 2 is wrong (too flexible can hide required data). Option 3 is too rigid (defaults improve usability). Option 4 is nonsense. Design principle: required data = no default; optional/convenience data = default value. When describing class design to AI: 'name and email are required, role defaults to user, created_at defaults to now.' This balances explicitness with usability. Lesson 3 covers default parameter patterns and when each approach fits.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the critical difference between instance attributes and class attributes in memory?",
      options: [
        "Instance attributes: each object has own copy; class attributes: shared by all",
        "Instance attributes are faster because they're stored differently",
        "Class attributes can only store strings; instance attributes any type",
        "Instance attributes must be public; class attributes must be private"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Instance attributes (like `self.name`) are stored per-object—each instance has its own copy. Class attributes (like `species = 'Dog'` defined in class body) are shared across all instances—one copy in memory that all objects access. Option 2 is wrong (no speed difference in this context). Option 3 is false (both can store any type). Option 4 is false (access control is independent of attribute type). Use case: `Dog.species` should be class attribute (all dogs are 'Canis familiaris'), but `dog.name` should be instance attribute (each dog has unique name). When working with AI: 'make base_url a class attribute since all API clients share it, but make api_key instance attribute since each client has unique credentials.' Lesson 3 demonstrates this with experiments.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes"
    },
    {
      question: "You have `class Counter: count = 0`. Then `c1 = Counter(); c1.count = 5`. What happened?",
      options: [
        "Created instance attribute on c1 shadowing the class attribute",
        "Modified the class attribute; all Counter objects now see 5",
        "Raised AttributeError; cannot modify class attributes through instances",
        "Created a reference; c1.count and Counter.count are now linked"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Assigning `c1.count = 5` creates a new instance attribute on c1, shadowing the class attribute. Now `c1.count` returns 5 (instance attribute), but `c2.count` and `Counter.count` still return 0 (class attribute). This shadowing is often unintentional and confusing. Option 2 is wrong—to modify class attributes, use `Counter.count = 5`. Option 3 is wrong—Python allows this, which is part of the problem. Option 4 is wrong—no linking occurs. To detect shadowing: check `'count' in c1.__dict__` (True = instance attribute). When reviewing AI-generated code where objects need shared state, verify updates use `ClassName.attribute`, not `instance.attribute`. Lesson 3 demonstrates this trap and how to avoid it.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes"
    },
    {
      question: "Why is `def __init__(self, items: list = []):` considered dangerous?",
      options: [
        "Mutable default is shared across all instances, causing hidden bugs",
        "Lists are too large to use as default parameters",
        "The syntax is invalid; Python requires None for lists",
        "Empty lists cause the constructor to fail"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. When you use a mutable default like `[]` or `{}`, that same object is shared across all instances created without providing the parameter. So `obj1 = MyClass(); obj2 = MyClass(); obj1.items.append('x')` results in obj2.items also containing 'x'—unexpected sharing. Option 2 is false. Option 3 is wrong (syntax is valid, just problematic). Option 4 is false. Correct pattern: `def __init__(self, items: list = None): self.items = items if items is not None else []`. This creates a new list for each instance. When working with AI, if you see mutable defaults in generated code, request: 'use None as default and create new list inside __init__.' This is a classic Python gotcha covered in Lesson 3.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes"
    },
    {
      question: "You asked AI to create an APIClient class. It should use the same base_url for all clients but unique api_key per client. How should AI structure this?",
      options: [
        "base_url as class attribute; api_key as instance attribute in __init__",
        "Both base_url and api_key as instance attributes",
        "Both base_url and api_key as class attributes",
        "base_url as instance attribute; api_key as class attribute"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. `base_url` should be a class attribute (shared by all clients: `class APIClient: base_url = 'https://api.example.com'`). `api_key` should be instance attribute (unique per client: `def __init__(self, api_key): self.api_key = api_key`). This way, all clients hit the same API endpoint but authenticate with different keys. Option 2 wastes memory duplicating base_url. Option 3 makes all clients share the same api_key—security disaster. Option 4 is backwards. This demonstrates when shared state (class attribute) vs. independent state (instance attribute) is appropriate. Describing to AI: 'base_url is constant across all instances, api_key is unique per instance' signals this design. Lesson 3 covers choosing attribute scope based on data semantics.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary purpose of encapsulation in object-oriented programming?",
      options: [
        "Bundle data and methods together; control access to protect data integrity",
        "Make code run faster by hiding implementation details",
        "Prevent other developers from reading the code",
        "Automatically generate getters and setters for all attributes"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), then controlling access to protect data integrity. For example, making `balance` private and only allowing changes through validated `deposit()`/`withdraw()` methods prevents invalid states like negative balances. Option 2 is wrong—encapsulation is about design, not performance. Option 3 is wrong—it's about API design and validation, not secrecy. Option 4 is wrong—getters/setters are one mechanism, not the goal. When working with AI: 'encapsulate balance with validation' tells AI to use properties or methods to protect that data. Lesson 4 demonstrates this with BankAccount example where direct balance access allows corruption, but encapsulated access enforces rules.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Encapsulation and Method Types"
    },
    {
      question: "In Python, what do naming conventions communicate about attribute access?",
      options: [
        "_single_leading: internal use; __double_leading: name mangling; no_leading: public",
        "Any attribute with underscore is completely inaccessible from outside",
        "Python enforces private attributes at runtime; external access raises errors",
        "Naming conventions are cosmetic; Python has true access modifiers like Java"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Python uses conventions: no leading underscore = public API (`self.name`); single leading underscore = internal implementation, don't depend on it (`self._internal`); double leading underscore = name mangling to avoid conflicts in inheritance (`self.__private`). These are signals, not enforced barriers—you can still access `obj._internal` or `obj._ClassName__private`. Option 2 is wrong—Python doesn't enforce true privacy. Option 3 is wrong—no runtime errors for accessing underscored attributes. Option 4 is backwards—Python relies on conventions, not enforced modifiers like Java's `private`. When reviewing AI-generated code, underscored attributes signal 'implementation detail, subject to change.' Lesson 4 covers Python's 'we're all consenting adults' philosophy.",

        "Instance: operates on object state; Class: operates on class state; Static: utility function",
        "Always use instance methods; class and static methods are rarely needed",
        "Instance: public API; Class: protected methods; Static: private methods",
        "Use whichever is fastest for the operation being performed"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Instance methods (def method(self):) operate on instance state using `self`. Class methods (@classmethod, def method(cls):) operate on class state or serve as alternative constructors. Static methods (@staticmethod, def method():) are utility functions logically grouped with the class but don't need instance or class data. Option 2 is wrong—class/static methods have specific use cases. Option 3 confuses method types with access control. Option 4 is wrong—performance isn't the deciding factor. Example: `account.deposit(100)` = instance method (modifies this account); `Date.from_string('2024-01-01')` = class method (creates instance); `Math.calculate_distance(p1, p2)` = static method (utility).

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. @property lets you write methods that are accessed like attributes: `user.age` instead of `user.get_age()`. Behind the scenes, your method runs, allowing validation or computation. Example: `@property def balance(self): return self._balance` makes `account.balance` call the method. You can add `@balance.setter` to validate assignments: `account.balance = -100` can be rejected. Option 2 is wrong (caching is @functools.lru_cache). Option 3 is wrong (dataclasses do this). Option 4 is wrong (that's `frozen` in dataclasses or using __setattr__).

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. You'd store only celsius as instance data, then use @property to compute fahrenheit on-the-fly: `@property def fahrenheit(self): return self.celsius * 9/5 + 32`. This ensures fahrenheit is always in sync with celsius—no duplicate state. Option 2 creates synchronization bugs (if celsius changes, fahrenheit is stale). Option 3 works but isn't Pythonic (prefer attribute access over method calls for simple access). Option 4 is wrong—temperatures are instance data. When describing to AI: 'celsius is stored attribute, fahrenheit is computed property' signals this pattern. This demonstrates encapsulation: internal representation (celsius) differs from external interface (both celsius and fahrenheit appear as attributes). Lesson 4 covers computed properties.",

      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. @classmethod receives `cls` (the class) as first parameter instead of `self` (instance). This enables: (1) accessing/modifying class attributes (`cls.count += 1`), and (2) alternative constructors that return class instances (`@classmethod def from_string(cls, date_str): return cls(...)`). Option 2 is wrong—no performance benefit. Option 3 is misleading—static methods do this better for utilities that don't need `cls`. Option 4 is wrong—validation is separate concern. When working with AI: 'create a from_json class method that deserializes JSON into an object' tells AI to use @classmethod. Example: `user = User.from_json(json_data)` calls class method that creates instance. Lesson 4 demonstrates class methods as factory patterns.",

        "Static methods are deprecated; use class methods instead"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Static methods are utility functions that don't need `self` or `cls` but are logically part of the class. Example: `class Math: @staticmethod def add(a, b): return a + b`. Calling `Math.add(2, 3)` groups the utility with Math class without needing instance/class data. Option 2 describes class methods, not static. Option 3 is impossible—can't access instance data without self. Option 4 is false—static methods are valid. When to use: function conceptually belongs to class but is pure computation. When working with AI: 'create a validate_email static method' signals this pattern. However, static methods are less common in Python than instance/class methods—often a module-level function is clearer. Lesson 4 covers this distinction.",

      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Test behavior, not just existence: `player = Player(); initial = player.health; player.take_damage(30); assert player.health == initial - 30`. Same for Enemy. This verifies implementation correctness. Option 2 is insufficient—method might exist but be buggy. Option 3 is wrong—type hints check types, not logic. Option 4 is wrong—ABCs enforce existence, not correctness of implementation. Testing principle: verify observable behavior (health decreases by damage amount), not internal implementation details. When working with AI: 'generate tests verifying take_damage() reduces health correctly for both Player and Enemy' produces behavior-focused tests.

      question: "You're extending the Game Character System to add a Boss class with special abilities. What's the OOP approach?",

        "Modify Enemy class to include boss-specific code with conditionals"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Boss IS-A type of Enemy with enhanced capabilities, so inherit: `class Boss(Enemy): def __init__(self): super().__init__(); self.health *= 3; def special_attack(self): ...`. Boss reuses Enemy's core behavior and adds specialization. Option 2 violates DRY and creates maintenance nightmare. Option 3 loses code reuse benefits. Option 4 pollutes Enemy with boss-specific logic (violates single responsibility). This demonstrates inheritance for specialization. When describing to AI: 'create Boss class inheriting from Enemy with triple health and special_attack method' signals this extension pattern. Good OOP design enables extending systems without modifying existing code. Lesson 5's extension suggestions include adding Boss via inheritance.",

      question: "What does it mean that objects have 'independent state' in OOP?",
      options: [
        "Each object's attributes are stored separately; modifying one doesn't affect others",
        "Objects cannot communicate or interact with each other",
        "Each object must be in a separate file",
        "Objects share state for efficiency but appear independent"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Independent state means each object has its own memory for attributes: `player1 = Player('Alice'); player2 = Player('Bob'); player1.health = 50` only affects player1, not player2. They're stored in different memory locations. Option 2 is wrong—objects can interact (player attacks enemy). Option 3 confuses code organization with memory. Option 4 is backwards—state is actually separate, not just appearing so. This independence is core to OOP's power: you can create 1,000 players, each with different health/inventory, without them interfering. Testing for this: modify one instance, assert others unchanged. When AI generates multi-object systems, verify `self.attribute` is used (instance data), not class attributes (shared data). Lesson 2 demonstrates and tests object independence.",

      question: "When reviewing AI-generated class code, what's a red flag that suggests mixing procedural and OOP styles incorrectly?",

        "Methods that accept parameters; OOP should use only attributes",
        "Classes with more than 5 methods; too complex for OOP",
        "Using __init__ constructor; real OOP uses class attributes"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. If instance methods don't access `self`, they're probably utilities that should be module functions or @staticmethod. Example: `def calculate_distance(self, p1, p2): return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x)**2 + ...)` doesn't use self—should be static method or module function. Option 2 is wrong—methods should accept parameters for flexibility. Option 3 is arbitrary—classes can have many methods. Option 4 is backwards—__init__ is fundamental to OOP. This signals code smell: method in class but doesn't need object state. When AI does this, request: 'move calculate_distance to module level or make it @staticmethod since it doesn't need instance data.' Lessons 2 and 4 cover proper method design.",

        "Instance attribute; each component might need different log files",

        "Neither; use function parameters instead of attributes"

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. If ALL loggers share one file, use class attribute: `class Logger: log_file = 'app.log'`. All instances access the same path. If requirement changes to 'each component CAN have different log file,' use instance attribute with class attribute as default: `def __init__(self, log_file=None): self.log_file = log_file or Logger.log_file`. Option 2 might be correct depending on requirements. Option 3 works but isn't OOP. Option 4 misses the point—you need to store this somewhere. Design decision: shared across all = class attribute; unique per instance = instance attribute. When describing to AI, specify: 'all loggers use the same log file' → class attribute; 'each logger can have different log file' → instance attribute. Lesson 3 covers choosing attribute scope.",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. Type hints communicate intent to AI and human developers: 'name should be str, age should be int.' When AI generates methods using these attributes, it knows: 'age is int, so I can use numeric operations.' Type hints also enable IDE autocomplete and type checkers like mypy. Option 2 is wrong—Python's type hints are documentation, not runtime enforcement (unless you use Pydantic or similar). Option 3 is false—type hints are optional. Option 4 is false—type hints don't generate validation. When collaborating with AI: 'add type hints to constructor and all methods' improves generated code quality and catches type mismatches.

      explanation: "Option 1 is correct. `print(player1.__dict__)`, `print(player2.__dict__)` shows exactly what's stored on each instance: `{'name': 'Alice', 'health': 50, ...}`. This reveals: Are attributes set correctly? Are objects independent or sharing state? Are attributes instance or class level? Option 2 is premature—debug first. Option 3 makes things worse, not better. Option 4 abandons OOP without diagnosis. Additional diagnostics: `print(type(player1))` (verify object type), `dir(player1)` (see available methods), `id(player1)` (memory address). When working with AI to debug: 'print player1.__dict__ and player2.__dict__ to compare their states' helps identify where objects diverge from expected. Lesson 3 teaches using __dict__ for debugging attribute issues.",
