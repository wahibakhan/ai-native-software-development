# Classes and Objects Basics

In Lesson 1, you discovered WHY OOP exists. Now you'll learn the syntax for HOW to create classes and objects through hands-on experimentation with real-world domain examples, starting with Task management that you'll build throughout Part 5.

---

## Part 1: Experience Classes by Experimentation

**Your Role**: Code explorer discovering how Python implements objects

Before reading syntax explanations, you'll experiment with creating classes to develop intuition.

### Discovery Exercise: Build Classes Step by Step

**What is a class?** A class is a blueprint (template) for creating objects. Think of it like a task template: the class defines what properties a task can have, and objects are the individual tasks you create from it. The `class` keyword in Python defines this blueprint.

**Stage 1: The Simplest Possible Class**

Let's create the simplest possible class - a blueprint with no details yet.

Create a file called `task_experiments.py` and run this code:

```python
# The absolute minimum: a class with no content
class Task:
    pass

# Now create an object from this class
my_task = Task()

# What is my_task? Inspect it
print(type(my_task))
print(my_task)
print(dir(my_task))  # What attributes/methods does it have?
```

**Your task 1**: Run this and document:
- What does `type(my_task)` tell you?
- What does `print(my_task)` show you? (Pay attention to the memory address)
- What's in `dir(my_task)`? What default methods does Python give every object?

**Output:**
```
<class 'task_experiments.Task'>
<task_experiments.Task object at 0x7f8b8c0d5f90>
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subattr__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '__dict__']
```

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I created an empty class with just `pass`. When I inspect `dir(my_task)`, I see lots of methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__dict__`. Where do these come from? What's the relationship between a class and an object? Explain using a cookie-cutter analogy, then connect it to how a Task template and individual tasks work together."

**Expected Understanding**: AI will explain that classes are blueprints/templates (cookie cutter or task template), objects are instances created from them (cookies or individual tasks). Python gives every object default methods automatically. You'll understand the class-object relationship before coding more.

**Stage 2: Add Data to Task Objects**

**Pedagogical Note**: In this stage, we'll show you a way to add data to objects that WORKS but isn't the professional pattern. We're doing this deliberately so you understand WHY the proper pattern (constructors with `__init__`) exists. Discovery through contrast is powerful.

Now modify the code to represent real tasks:

```python
class Task:
    pass

# Create first task and add properties manually
my_task = Task()
my_task.title = "Review pull request"
my_task.done = False
my_task.priority = 2

print(f"Task: {my_task.title}")
print(f"Done: {my_task.done}")
print(f"Priority: {my_task.priority}")

# Create a second task
important_task = Task()
important_task.title = "Deploy to production"
important_task.done = False
important_task.priority = 1

print(f"Task: {important_task.title}")
print(f"Priority: {important_task.priority}")

# Question: If I change my_task properties, does important_task change?
my_task.priority = 5
print(f"\nAfter changing my_task priority to 5:")
print(f"my_task priority: {my_task.priority}")
print(f"important_task priority: {important_task.priority}")
```

**Your task 2**: Run this and answer:
- How do you add data to an object in Python?
- Are the objects independent? Prove it.
- What happens if you inspect `my_task.__dict__`? (This shows all attributes)

**Output:**
```
Task: Review pull request
Done: False
Priority: 2
Task: Deploy to production
Priority: 1

After changing my_task priority to 5:
my_task priority: 5
important_task priority: 1
```

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I'm adding attributes to Task objects using `my_task.title = 'Review PR'`. This works, but I have to repeat this for EVERY task I create. For 100 tasks, that's 300+ lines of attribute assignment! How do professional developers avoid this repetition? What Python feature lets me initialize task attributes automatically when creating a Task object? Give me a preview of the solution before I learn the syntax."

**Expected Understanding**: AI will preview the `__init__` method (constructor) that automatically runs when you create an object. You'll see WHY constructors exist before learning HOW they work. This motivates the learning in Part 2.

---

**Stage 3: Notice the Problem with Manual Attributes**

You've seen that adding attributes manually works. Now let's see why it's problematic at scale.

```python
class Task:
    pass

# This works, but is repetitive and error-prone
task1 = Task()
task1.title = "Review PR"
task1.done = False
task1.priority = 2

task2 = Task()
task2.title = "Deploy to production"
task2.done = False
task2.priority = 1

task3 = Task()
task3.title = "Fix bug in auth module"
task3.done = True
task3.priority = 3

# What if you create 100 tasks? You'd repeat setup code 100 times
# What if you forget to set priority for a task? (Silent error - no type safety)
# How do you FORCE every Task object to have title: str, done: bool, priority: int?
```

**Your task 3**: Before reading further, predict:
- What would solve the repetition problem?
- How could you ensure every Task object MUST have title: str, done: bool, priority: int?
- What language feature would enforce this at object creation time?

**Answer Preview**: The solution is the constructor (`__init__` method) with type hints. You'll learn this in the next section. This discovery exercise showed you the PAIN that constructors solve.

---

### Your Discovery Summary

Instead of manual documentation, **use AI to synthesize** what you learned:

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "Based on my experiments with creating Task classes and adding attributes manually, summarize these key insights:
> 1. What's the relationship between classes and objects? (blueprint vs instance)
> 2. How are Task objects independent? (each has its own memory)
> 3. What's the pain point with manual attribute assignment? (repetition, no enforcement)
> 4. What's the solution I'm about to learn? (constructors with __init__)
>
> Give me 3 concise bullet points I can reference in Part 2."

**Deliverable**: Save AI's synthesis in your notes. You've discovered the problem—now you're ready to learn the solution (`__init__` method) in Part 2.

---

## Part 2: Learn Class Syntax and Constructors with Task Methods

**Your Role**: Student receiving instruction from AI Teacher

Now that you've experienced the limitations of manual attribute setting, it's time to learn the solution using real Task management patterns.

![Anatomical breakdown of Python class structure showing class definition, __init__ constructor, instance attributes, instance methods, and the role of self parameter in connecting methods to object instances](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-5/chapter-27/python-class-structure-anatomy.png)

### AI Teaching Prompt

Ask your AI companion:

> "I've been creating Task objects and manually adding title, done, priority attributes to each one. This is repetitive:
> ```python
> task1 = Task()
> task1.title = 'Review PR'
> task1.done = False
> task1.priority = 2
>
> task2 = Task()
> task2.title = 'Deploy to production'
> # ... repeat for every task ...
> ```
>
> How can I force every Task to automatically initialize with title, done, priority when created? Show me the syntax and explain:
> 1. What is the `__init__` method?
> 2. What is `self`?
> 3. Why does Python require explicit `self` parameter?
> 4. Show me the same task-creating code but using __init__"

### What You'll Learn from AI

**Expected AI Response** (summary):

- **`__init__` method**: A special constructor that Python automatically calls when you create an object
- **`self`**: Represents "the object being created." It's always the first parameter
- **`self.title = title`**: Creates an attribute on THIS object
- **Why explicit self?**: Python wants you to be clear: you're setting attributes on a specific object

**AI will show you**:

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title: str, done: bool = False, priority: int = 5):
        self.title = title      # "Set THIS task's title"
        self.done = done        # "Set THIS task's done status"
        self.priority = priority  # "Set THIS task's priority"

# Now creation is much simpler!
task1 = Task("Review pull request", priority=2)
task2 = Task("Deploy to production", priority=1)

print(task1.title)  # Review pull request
print(task2.title)  # Deploy to production
print(task1.priority)  # 2
print(task2.priority)  # 1
```

**Output:**
```
Review pull request
Deploy to production
2
1
```

### Convergence Activity

After AI explains, **test your understanding**:

Ask AI: "Walk me through what happens in memory when I call `Task('Review PR', priority=2)`. Step by step: Python creates the object, then calls `__init__` with what self value? Show me how Python internally handles the 'self' parameter."

**Deliverable**: Write a summary explaining `__init__`, `self`, and why this solves the repetition problem compared to manual attribute setting.

---

## Part 3: Design Task Methods for State Changes

**Your Role**: Student designing behavior through instance methods

Now that you understand how to initialize Task objects, let's add methods that represent real task operations.

### Working with Task Methods

Real tasks need to DO things. Let's design methods that represent task operations:

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title: str, done: bool = False, priority: int = 5):
        self.title = title
        self.done = done
        self.priority = priority

    def mark_complete(self) -> None:
        """Mark the task as done."""
        self.done = True
        print(f"Task '{self.title}' marked as complete")

    def update_priority(self, new_priority: int) -> None:
        """Change task priority (1=highest, 10=lowest)."""
        if 1 <= new_priority <= 10:
            self.priority = new_priority
            print(f"Priority updated to {new_priority}")
        else:
            print("Priority must be between 1 and 10")

    def get_status(self) -> str:
        """Return current task status."""
        status = "✓ Complete" if self.done else "○ Pending"
        return f"{self.title} [{status}] - Priority: {self.priority}"

# Use the Task class with methods
task1 = Task("Review pull request", priority=2)
print(task1.get_status())

task1.update_priority(1)
print(task1.get_status())

task1.mark_complete()
print(task1.get_status())
```

**Output:**
```
Review pull request [○ Pending] - Priority: 2
Priority updated to 1
Review pull request [✓ Complete] - Priority: 1
Task 'Review pull request' marked as complete
```

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I've defined Task methods like `mark_complete()` and `update_priority()`. When I call `task1.mark_complete()`, how does Python know to modify task1's attributes, not task2's? Walk me through the method call: Python sees `task1.mark_complete()`, internally it must do something like `Task.mark_complete(task1)`. Explain how the self parameter makes this work automatically without me typing the object name."

---

### Challenge: Object Independence with Methods

**Your prompt to AI**:

> "I create two Task objects and modify one:
> ```python
> task1 = Task('Review PR', priority=2)
> task2 = Task('Deploy to production', priority=1)
> task1.mark_complete()
> task1.update_priority(5)
> ```
>
> After this, what are:
> - `task1.done`? `task1.priority`?
> - `task2.done`? `task2.priority`?
>
> Why didn't task2 change when I modified task1? Explain what's happening in memory that makes them separate."

**Expected learning**: AI will explain that each object has its own memory space for attributes. This is the fundamental power of objects. Methods operate on specific instances.

**Output:**
```
task1.done = True
task1.priority = 5
task2.done = False
task2.priority = 1
# task2 is independent!
```

---

## Part 4: Pattern Transfer Across Domains

**Your Role**: Knowledge synthesizer discovering pattern universality

You've learned classes using Task. Now you'll see that these SAME PATTERNS apply to completely different domains.

### Domain Transfer: Legal, Finance, Healthcare

The Task class pattern appears everywhere. Here's how it transfers:

#### Domain 1: Legal Case Management

```python
class Case:
    def __init__(self, case_number: str, title: str, client_name: str):
        self.case_number = case_number
        self.title = title
        self.client_name = client_name
        self.status = "open"

    def close_case(self) -> None:
        """Close the case."""
        self.status = "closed"
        print(f"Case {self.case_number} closed")

    def assign_attorney(self, attorney_name: str) -> None:
        """Assign attorney to case."""
        self.attorney = attorney_name
        print(f"Attorney {attorney_name} assigned to {self.case_number}")

# Usage
case1 = Case("2025-CV-1234", "Smith v. Jones", "Smith Corp")
print(f"Case: {case1.title} - Status: {case1.status}")
case1.close_case()
```

**Output:**
```
Case: Smith v. Jones - Status: open
Case 2025-CV-1234 closed
```

#### Domain 2: Finance Invoice Management

```python
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, invoice_id: str, client_name: str, amount: float):
        self.invoice_id = invoice_id
        self.client_name = client_name
        self.amount = amount
        self.is_paid = False

    def mark_paid(self) -> None:
        """Mark invoice as paid."""
        self.is_paid = True
        print(f"Invoice {self.invoice_id} marked as paid")

    def apply_discount(self, discount_percent: float) -> None:
        """Apply discount to invoice amount."""
        discount = self.amount * (discount_percent / 100)
        self.amount -= discount
        print(f"Discount applied: ${discount:.2f}")

# Usage
invoice1 = Invoice("INV-2025-001", "Acme Corp", 5000.00)
print(f"Invoice {invoice1.invoice_id}: ${invoice1.amount}")
invoice1.apply_discount(10)
print(f"After discount: ${invoice1.amount}")
```

**Output:**
```
Invoice INV-2025-001: $5000.0
Discount applied: $500.00
After discount: $4500.0
```

#### Domain 3: Healthcare Appointment Scheduling

```python
class Appointment:
    def __init__(self, appointment_id: str, patient_name: str, doctor_name: str):
        self.appointment_id = appointment_id
        self.patient_name = patient_name
        self.doctor_name = doctor_name
        self.is_confirmed = False

    def confirm(self) -> None:
        """Confirm the appointment."""
        self.is_confirmed = True
        print(f"Appointment {self.appointment_id} confirmed")

    def reschedule(self, new_doctor: str) -> None:
        """Reschedule with different doctor."""
        self.doctor_name = new_doctor
        self.is_confirmed = False
        print(f"Rescheduled with Dr. {new_doctor}")

# Usage
apt1 = Appointment("APT-2025-0001", "John Doe", "Dr. Smith")
print(f"Appointment with Dr. {apt1.doctor_name}")
apt1.confirm()
apt1.reschedule("Dr. Johnson")
```

**Output:**
```
Appointment with Dr. Smith
Appointment APT-2025-0001 confirmed
Rescheduled with Dr. Johnson
```

### Pattern Comparison Table

| Pattern | Task | Case | Invoice | Appointment |
|---------|------|------|---------|-------------|
| Attributes | title, done, priority | case_number, status, client | invoice_id, amount, is_paid | appointment_id, is_confirmed |
| Constructor | `__init__(title, priority)` | `__init__(case_number, title)` | `__init__(invoice_id, amount)` | `__init__(appointment_id, patient)` |
| Key method | `mark_complete()` | `close_case()` | `mark_paid()` | `confirm()` |
| Status change | done → True | status → "closed" | is_paid → True | is_confirmed → True |

**Key insight**: The PATTERN is identical across all domains. Only the data and method names change. You're not learning Task-specific syntax—you're learning a universal Python pattern.

#### 💬 AI CoLearning Prompt

> "I've now seen Task, Case, Invoice, and Appointment classes. They all follow the same pattern:
> - Constructor initializes attributes
> - Methods modify that state
> - Each object maintains independent state
>
> What's the universal pattern here? If I encounter a completely new domain (e.g., Product inventory, Restaurant reservation, Library book), how would I design a class using what I've learned?"

**Deliverable**: Write a summary showing how the Task pattern applies universally.

---

## Part 5: Build Your Class Design Patterns Reference

**Your Role**: Knowledge synthesizer creating design templates

Now integrate everything into reusable patterns for designing classes in any domain.

### Your Class Design Template

Create a markdown file called `class_design_patterns.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Class Design Patterns

## Pattern 1: Simple Data Container with State Methods

**When to use**: Class representing a real-world entity with state and operations

**Template**:
```python
class Entity:
    def __init__(self, required_attr: str, optional_attr: str = "default"):
        self.required_attr = required_attr
        self.optional_attr = optional_attr
        self.status = "initial_state"

    def perform_action(self) -> None:
        """Describe what this method does."""
        self.status = "new_state"
```

**Key points**:
- Constructor parameters match required attributes
- Type hints on parameters
- Status attributes track entity state
- Methods change state through self.attribute assignments

---

## Pattern 2: Methods with Parameters

**When to use**: Methods that modify state based on input

**Template**:
```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title: str, priority: int = 5):
        self.title = title
        self.priority = priority

    def update_priority(self, new_priority: int) -> None:
        """Update priority with validation."""
        if 1 &lt;= new_priority &lt;= 10:
            self.priority = new_priority
        else:
            raise ValueError("Priority must be 1-10")
```

**Key points**:
- Parameters enable method flexibility
- Validation happens in methods
- Methods can raise exceptions for invalid input
- Always use type hints

---

## Pattern 3: Methods with Return Values

**When to use**: Methods that compute or retrieve data

**Template**:
```python
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, amount: float):
        self.amount = amount
        self.is_paid = False

    def remaining_balance(self) -> float:
        """Return amount still owed."""
        return self.amount if not self.is_paid else 0.0
```

**Key points**:
- Use return type hints (-> type)
- Methods should return data, not just print
- Callers can use returned values

---

## Pattern 4: Object Independence Verification

**How to verify objects are truly independent**:

```python
# Create two objects
task1 = Task("Review PR", priority=2)
task2 = Task("Deploy", priority=1)

# Modify one
task1.update_priority(5)

# Verify other is unchanged
assert task1.priority == 5
assert task2.priority == 1  # ✓ task2 is independent

print("Objects are independent!")
```

**Why this matters**: Confirms that each object has its own memory space.

---

## Pattern 5: The Self Parameter Explained

**Memory model**:
```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title: str):
        self.title = title  # "THIS task's title"

    def get_title(self) -> str:
        return self.title  # "THIS task's title"

task1 = Task("Review PR")
task2 = Task("Deploy")

# When you call task1.get_title():
# Python mentally does: Task.get_title(task1)
# "self" inside the method refers to task1
```

**Key insight**: `self` = "the specific object this method is operating on"

---

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting `self` in methods
```python
# ❌ WRONG
def mark_complete():
    done = True

# ✅ CORRECT
def mark_complete(self):
    self.done = True
```

### Mistake 2: Not calling constructor
```python
# ❌ WRONG
task = Task  # Missing ()

# ✅ CORRECT
task = Task("Review PR")
```

### Mistake 3: Forgetting `self.` when accessing attributes
```python
# ❌ WRONG
def get_info(self):
    return title  # Where does 'title' come from?

# ✅ CORRECT
def get_info(self):
    return self.title  # THIS object's title
```

---

## Testing Pattern: Verify Independence

**Always test that objects are independent**:

```python
task1 = Task("Review PR", priority=2)
task2 = Task("Deploy", priority=1)

task1.update_priority(5)

assert task1.priority == 5
assert task2.priority == 1  # ← Unchanged!
```
```

### Validation with AI

Once your patterns are complete, validate them:

> "Review my class design patterns. Are my explanations of self and object independence accurate? What patterns am I missing? What common mistakes should I add?"

**Deliverable**: Complete `class_design_patterns.md` with patterns and quick reference guide.

> "Show me a Task class with title, priority, and due_date attributes. Add methods: mark_complete(), delay_deadline(days), and get_status(). Create three task objects with different priorities. When I call task1.mark_complete(), show step-by-step what happens in memory. How does Python know to modify only task1 and not task2?"

**🎯 Practice Domain Transfer:**
> "I'm building [describe your system: legal case management, invoice processing, appointment scheduling, etc.]. Help me design one core entity class. Walk me through: what attributes describe it? What methods represent key operations? How would I initialize multiple objects and modify them independently? Show code with test examples."

**🧪 Test Object Independence:**
> "Create a Case class with case_number, status, and client_name attributes. Add methods: close_case() and assign_attorney(attorney). Make three case objects. Close the first case and change its attorney. Show that the other two cases are unaffected. Why are they independent?"

**🚀 Apply Pattern Across Domains:**
> "I've learned Task classes with methods. Show me how the same pattern applies to: Invoice (with mark_paid() and apply_discount()), Appointment (with confirm() and reschedule()), and Product (with adjust_price() and restock()). How is the pattern universal across domains?"
