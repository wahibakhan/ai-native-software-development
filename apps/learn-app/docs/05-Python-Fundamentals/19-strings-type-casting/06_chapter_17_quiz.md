  questions={[    {
      question: "What happens when you try to change a single character in an existing string?",
      options: [
        "The character changes and the original string is modified",
        "Python creates a new string with the changed character",
        "Python raises a TypeError because strings are immutable",
        "The character changes but the length remains the same"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Strings are immutable in Python, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. Attempting to modify a string character (like text[0] = 'H') raises a TypeError with the message 'str object does not support item assignment'. This immutability makes strings predictable and safe—once created, a string will never secretly change. If you need to 'change' a string, you must create a new one using operations like concatenation or methods like replace().",
      source: "Lesson 1: String Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "Given the code: text = 'Python' and result = text[2]. What does result contain?",
      options: [
        "The character 't' at index 2",
        "The character 'y' at index 2",
        "The substring 'Py' from start to index 2",
        "The character 'P' at the beginning"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Python uses 0-based indexing, so index 2 refers to the third character. In 'Python', index 0 is 'P', index 1 is 'y', and index 2 is 't'. The square bracket notation text[2] accesses a single character, not a substring. This returns the character 't' as a string. Understanding 0-based indexing is fundamental to working with strings and other sequences in Python.",
      source: "Lesson 1: String Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the result of: len('Hello') + len('')?",
      options: [
        "5 because len ignores the empty string",
        "6 because empty string counts as 1 character",
        "Error because len cannot process empty strings",
        "5 because the empty string has length 0"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The len() built-in function counts the number of characters in a string. 'Hello' has 5 characters, so len('Hello') returns 5. An empty string '' has 0 characters, so len('') returns 0. Adding these results: 5 + 0 = 5. Empty strings are valid strings—they just contain no characters. The len() function handles empty strings without error, returning 0.",
      source: "Lesson 1: String Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the expression 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' produce?",
      options: [
        "The string 'HelloWorld' without any space",
        "The string 'Hello World' with a space",
        "A list containing 'Hello' and 'World' elements",
        "An error because strings cannot be added"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The + operator performs string concatenation, joining strings together in the order specified. 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' first joins 'Hello' with the space character ' ', producing 'Hello ', then joins that result with 'World', producing 'Hello World'. Notice that the space must be explicitly added—without it, the result would be 'HelloWorld'. Concatenation is a fundamental string operation for building larger strings from smaller pieces.",
      source: "Lesson 1: String Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the output of: print('*' * 5)?",
      options: [
        "The number 5 repeated five times",
        "The string '* * * * *' with spaces",
        "The string '*****' (five asterisks)",
        "An error because multiplication is for numbers"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The * operator performs string repetition when used with a string and an integer. '*' * 5 repeats the string '*' exactly 5 times, producing '*****'. This is useful for creating patterns, dividers, or repeated elements (like separator: str = '-' * 20 creates '--------------------'). Note that repetition does not add spaces between copies—it simply concatenates the string with itself the specified number of times.",
      source: "Lesson 1: String Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you use isinstance(value, str) before performing string operations?",
      options: [
        "To verify the value is a string type",
        "To convert the value into a string automatically",
        "To measure the length of the string value",
        "To check if the string contains valid characters"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "isinstance(value, str) returns True if the value is a string, False otherwise. Using it before string operations prevents errors when a variable unexpectedly contains a different type (like an integer). For example, if you try name.upper() but name is actually 42 (an integer), Python raises AttributeError. Checking isinstance(value, str) first lets you handle non-string values gracefully. This validation-first approach is a professional best practice.",
      source: "Lesson 1: String Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "Given: text = 'hello'. What does text.upper() do to the original variable text?",
      options: [
        "Changes text to 'HELLO' by modifying it",
        "Nothing because strings are immutable; text remains 'hello'",
        "Creates a copy and modifies the copy only",
        "Raises an error because strings cannot change"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "String methods like upper() return a new string—they do not modify the original. Since strings are immutable, text.upper() produces 'HELLO' as a new string, but the variable text still contains 'hello'. To use the uppercase version, you must capture the result: uppercase = text.upper(). If you just call text.upper() without saving it, the result is discarded. Understanding immutability is critical for predicting method behavior.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'Python Programming'.split() return?",
      options: [
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The split() method breaks a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter. When called with no arguments, split() uses whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as the default delimiter. 'Python Programming'.split() splits at the space, returning ['Python', 'Programming']. This is useful for parsing sentences into words. Note that split() returns a list, not a string or tuple. You can then use join() to reassemble the pieces.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the result of: ' '.join(['apple', 'banana', 'orange'])?",
      options: [
        "A list containing 'apple banana orange' as one element",
        "The string 'applebananaorange' with no spaces",
        "The string 'apple banana orange' with spaces",
        "An error because join requires a string delimiter"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The join() method combines a list of strings into a single string, inserting a separator between elements. The syntax is: separator.join(list). In ' '.join(['apple', 'banana', 'orange']), the separator is a space ' ', so the result is 'apple banana orange'. If you used ','.join(...), you'd get 'apple,banana,orange'. join() is the inverse of split()—split() breaks strings apart, join() reassembles them. Note that join() only works with lists of strings.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'hello world'.find('o') return?",
      options: [
        "The index 4, the first occurrence of 'o'",
        "The index 7, the last occurrence of 'o'",
        "The boolean True because 'o' is present",
        "A list containing all positions of 'o'"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The find() method returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a substring. In 'hello world', the first 'o' appears at index 4 (positions: h=0, e=1, l=2, l=3, o=4). If the substring is not found, find() returns -1 (not an error or exception). This makes find() useful for checking if a substring exists: if text.find('pattern') >= 0 means 'pattern' was found. Unlike some methods, find() returns an integer index, not a boolean.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'hello world'.replace('world', 'Python') produce?",
      options: [
        "The string 'Python hello' with words reversed",
        "The string 'hello Python' with 'world' replaced",
        "The original string 'hello world' because replace fails",
        "An error because replace needs exact case match"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The replace() method returns a new string with all occurrences of the old substring replaced by the new substring. 'hello world'.replace('world', 'Python') finds 'world' and replaces it with 'Python', producing 'hello Python'. Since strings are immutable, the original string remains unchanged. replace() is case-sensitive, so replace('World', 'Python') would not match 'world'. You can specify a third argument to limit replacements: replace('old', 'new', 1) replaces only the first occurrence.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the output of: '  hello  '.strip()?",
      options: [
        "An error because strip needs delimiter argument",
        "The string '  hello  ' unchanged",
        "The string 'hlo' with all spaces removed",
        "The string 'hello' with whitespace removed"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The strip() method removes leading (beginning) and trailing (ending) whitespace from a string. '  hello  '.strip() returns 'hello' with the spaces removed from both sides. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newlines. Note that strip() only removes whitespace from the edges—it does not remove spaces between words (use replace(' ', '') for that). strip() is essential for cleaning user input, which often has accidental spaces.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What does '  HELLO  '.strip().lower().replace('L', 'r') return?",
      options: [
        "The string 'herro' after chaining three methods",
        "An error because you cannot chain methods",
        "The string 'HELLO' because strip does nothing",
        "The string '  herro  ' with spaces preserved"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Method chaining works because each string method returns a string, allowing you to call another method immediately. '  HELLO  '.strip() returns 'HELLO' (removed spaces), then .lower() returns 'hello' (lowercase), then .replace('L', 'r') returns 'herro' (all 'L' characters replaced). Note that replace() is case-sensitive, so it replaces lowercase 'l' (not uppercase 'L'). The final result is 'herro'. Method chaining is powerful for text processing pipelines.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Essential String Methods"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of f-strings compared to regular string concatenation?",
      options: [
        "F-strings are the only way to create strings",
        "F-strings automatically convert all values to integers first",
        "F-strings make embedding variables more readable and concise",
        "F-strings prevent any type conversion from occurring"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "F-strings (formatted string literals) make it easy to embed variables and expressions directly in strings using curly braces. Instead of 'Hello, ' + name + '!', you write f'Hello, {name}!'. This is more readable, especially with multiple variables. F-strings also handle type conversion automatically (no need for str(age)), and you can include expressions like f'{x + y}'. They represent modern Python style (Python 3.6+) and are preferred over older methods like % formatting and .format().",
      source: "Lesson 3: F-String Formatting"
    },
    {
      question: "What does f'Result: {5 + 3}' produce?",
      options: [
        "The string 'Result: {5 + 3}' with braces shown",
        "The string 'Result: 8' with the expression evaluated",
        "An error because expressions are not allowed",
        "The string 'Result: 53' with values concatenated"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "F-strings evaluate expressions inside curly braces and insert the result into the string. f'Result: {5 + 3}' calculates 5 + 3 = 8, then inserts '8' into the string, producing 'Result: 8'. You can use any Python expression: arithmetic (x + y), method calls (text.upper()), or function calls (len(name)). The expression result is automatically converted to a string. This makes f-strings powerful for dynamic output. Without the 'f' prefix, the braces would appear literally.",
      source: "Lesson 3: F-String Formatting"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the output of: price = 19.5 and f'${price:.2f}'?",
      options: [
        "An error because .2f syntax is invalid",
        "The string '$19.5' with one decimal place",
        "The string '$19.500' with three decimal places",
        "The string '$19.50' with exactly two decimal places"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Format specifiers control how values are displayed in f-strings. The syntax {value:.2f} means 'format the number with 2 decimal places'. The colon : separates the variable from the format spec, .2f means 2 digits after the decimal point, and f stands for 'floating point'. f'${price:.2f}' with price = 19.5 produces '$19.50', adding a zero to ensure exactly 2 decimals. This is essential for currency formatting, ensuring consistent display regardless of the original value.",
      source: "Lesson 3: F-String Formatting"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if you forget the 'f' prefix: name = 'Alice' and '{name}'?",
      options: [
        "The variable name is embedded but without formatting",
        "Python automatically detects the variable and embeds it",
        "The string '{name}' is returned literally",
        "An error occurs because braces are invalid"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The 'f' prefix is what tells Python to interpret curly braces as placeholders for expressions. Without it, '{name}' is just a regular string containing literal curly braces—Python does not evaluate the content. This is a common mistake. The result is the string '{name}', not 'Alice'. To embed variables, you must use f'{name}' with the f prefix. Regular strings treat braces as normal characters. This is why f-strings are called 'formatted string literals'—the 'f' activates the formatting.",
      source: "Lesson 3: F-String Formatting"
    },
    {
      question: "What does f'{10:.0f}' produce?",
      options: [
        "The string '10' with no decimal places",
        "The string '10.0' with one decimal place",
        "The string '10.00' with two decimal places",
        "An error because integers do not need formatting"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The format specifier :.0f means 'format as a floating-point number with 0 decimal places'. f'{10:.0f}' displays the number 10 without any decimal point or digits after it, producing '10'. This is useful when you want to display a float as a whole number (like converting 10.7 to '11' by rounding). The .Nf pattern controls decimal places: .0f = no decimals, .1f = 1 decimal, .2f = 2 decimals, etc. This works with both integers and floats.",
      source: "Lesson 3: F-String Formatting"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the result of: int('42')?",
      options: [
        "The string '42' returned unchanged",
        "The integer 42 converted from the string",
        "An error because '42' is already an integer",
        "The float 42.0 converted from the string"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The int() function converts a string to an integer if the string contains a valid integer representation. int('42') parses the string '42' and returns the integer 42. This is essential for processing user input, which always arrives as strings. After conversion, you can perform arithmetic: result = int('42') + 8 produces 50. Note that int('42') succeeds but int('3.14') fails with ValueError because '3.14' is not a valid integer format. Always validate input before conversion.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Type Casting Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you call int('3.14')?",
      options: [
        "Python returns 3.14 as a float automatically",
        "Python returns 3 by truncating the decimal part",
        "Python returns 4 by rounding to nearest integer",
        "Python raises ValueError because '3.14' is not valid"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The int() function expects a string containing only digits (and optionally a sign). '3.14' contains a decimal point, which is not valid for int(), so Python raises ValueError with the message 'invalid literal for int()'. To convert '3.14' to an integer, you must first convert to float: int(float('3.14')) produces 3 (the decimal part is truncated, not rounded). This demonstrates why validation before conversion is critical—attempting conversion on invalid input crashes your program unless you handle the error.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Type Casting Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What does float('19.99') return?",
      options: [
        "The float 19.99 converted from the string",
        "The integer 19 by truncating the decimal",
        "The string '19.99' returned unchanged",
        "An error because floats need two arguments"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The float() function converts a string to a floating-point number if the string contains a valid decimal representation. float('19.99') parses the string '19.99' and returns the float 19.99. Unlike int(), float() accepts decimal points. This is essential for handling prices, measurements, and other decimal values from user input. After conversion, you can perform arithmetic: total = float('19.99') * 1.08 calculates tax. float() also accepts integer strings: float('42') returns 42.0.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Type Casting Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What does str(42) produce?",
      options: [
        "An error because integers cannot become strings",
        "The integer 42 returned unchanged",
        "The string '42' converted from the integer",
        "The float 42.0 with decimal added"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The str() function converts any value to its string representation. str(42) produces the string '42'. This conversion always succeeds—unlike int() and float(), which can fail with invalid input. You need str() when concatenating numbers with text: 'You have ' + str(42) + ' items' (though f-strings handle this automatically: f'You have {42} items'). str() is also useful for displaying calculated results, formatting output, or preparing data for file storage.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Type Casting Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What does bool('') return?",
      options: [
        "None because empty strings have no value",
        "True because it is a valid string",
        "An error because bool needs True/False input",
        "False because the string is empty"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The bool() function converts any value to True or False based on Python's truthiness rules. For strings, the rule is: empty string '' is False, any non-empty string is True. bool('') returns False. Surprisingly, bool('False') returns True (the string 'False' is non-empty). For numbers, 0 and 0.0 are False, all other numbers are True. Understanding truthiness is critical for conditionals: if user_input: checks whether the string is non-empty without explicitly comparing to ''.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Type Casting Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What does bool('0') return?",
      options: [
        "False because the string contains zero",
        "True because the string is non-empty",
        "An error because '0' is ambiguous",
        "None because strings are not boolean"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "This is a common source of confusion. bool() applied to strings checks if the string is empty, not what the string contains. The string '0' is non-empty (it contains the character '0'), so bool('0') returns True. Compare this to bool(0), which returns False because the number 0 is falsy. To check if a string represents the number zero, you must convert it first: bool(int('0')) returns False. Always remember: for strings, only '' is False; any other string (even ' ' or '0') is True.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Type Casting Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you use text.isdigit() before calling int(text)?",
      options: [
        "To validate the string contains only digits first",
        "To automatically convert the string to an integer",
        "To check if the integer is positive",
        "To measure the length of the numeric string"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The isdigit() method returns True if the string contains only digit characters (0-9), False otherwise. Checking text.isdigit() before calling int(text) prevents ValueError when the string contains non-numeric characters. For example, '42'.isdigit() is True (safe to convert), but '3.14'.isdigit() is False (would fail conversion). This validation-first approach is professional best practice: validate before converting, and handle invalid input gracefully with error messages instead of crashes.",

    },
    {
      question: "What is the result of: '  42  '.strip().isdigit()?",
      options: [
        "An error because strip and isdigit conflict",
        "False because the original string has spaces",
        "True because stripping whitespace reveals valid digits",
        "None because whitespace invalidates the check"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Method chaining allows you to clean and validate in one expression. '  42  '.strip() removes whitespace, returning '42'. Then .isdigit() checks if '42' contains only digits, returning True. This pattern is essential for validating user input: users often accidentally include spaces, so strip() removes them before validation. The complete pattern is: clean with strip(), validate with isdigit(), then convert with int(). Without strip(), '  42  '.isdigit() would return False because spaces are not digits.",

      question: "Given: text = 'Hello'; result = text + '!'. What type is result?",
      options: [
        "None because strings cannot be concatenated",
        "List because concatenation creates a sequence",
        "Integer because the exclamation mark has ASCII value",
        "String (str) because concatenation returns a string"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "String concatenation with the + operator always returns a string. text + '!' joins 'Hello' and '!' into the new string 'Hello!'. Both operands must be strings—mixing types like 'Hello' + 5 raises TypeError. To verify the result type, use isinstance(result, str), which returns True. Understanding that operations return consistent types helps you predict behavior and avoid type errors. If you need to concatenate a string and number, convert the number first: text + str(5).",

    {
      question: "What does 'hello'.upper().lower().upper() produce?",
      options: [
        "The string 'hello' because lower cancels upper",

        "An error because methods conflict with each other",
        "The string 'HeLLo' with alternating case"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Each method in the chain operates on the result of the previous method. 'hello'.upper() returns 'HELLO'. Then .lower() returns 'hello'. Finally .upper() returns 'HELLO'. Each method call creates a new string, and methods don't 'cancel out'—each transforms the current string state. The last method determines the final result. This example demonstrates that method order matters and that each operation is independent. In practice, such chains are rare, but understanding them helps debug complex text processing.",

    {
      question: "What does 'a,b,c'.split(',') return?",
      options: [
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The split() method accepts an optional delimiter argument specifying where to split. 'a,b,c'.split(',') splits at each comma, returning the list ['a', 'b', 'c']. This is useful for parsing CSV data, tags, or other delimited formats. Compare this to split() with no arguments, which splits on whitespace.

'hello world'.find('x') returns -1 because 'x' does not appear in the string. This design allows you to check for existence without exception handling: if text.find('pattern') >= 0: means the pattern was found.

If you want to replace only the first occurrence, use a third argument specifying the maximum number of replacements: replace('p', 'b', 1) would produce 'abple'. replace() is case-sensitive, so replace('P', 'b') would not match lowercase 'p'.

Compare this to rstrip(), which removes only trailing whitespace, and strip(), which removes both. lstrip() is useful when you need to preserve formatting on one side while cleaning the other.

      explanation: "F-strings can contain expressions and format specifiers simultaneously. 100 / 3 evaluates to 33.333333..., then :.1f formats the result with 1 decimal place, producing 33.3 (rounded). The complete f-string produces 'Value: 33.3'. This demonstrates combining calculation and formatting in a single expression.

The result is '5'. You can call any function, use method calls (text.upper()), or write complex expressions.

Note that only the expression result is lowercase—the literal text 'Hello, ' remains unchanged. You can chain methods: f'{name.upper().replace('A', '@')}' would produce 'HELLO'.

      explanation: "Format specifiers work with literal numbers, not just variables. f'Price: ${9.5:.2f}' applies :.2f to the literal 9.5, formatting it with 2 decimal places as 9.50, then inserts it into the string, producing 'Price: $9.50'. This is useful for formatting constant values or expressions directly without storing them in variables first. The same specifier works with variables: f'${price:.2f}'. Format specifiers ensure consistent decimal places regardless of the original value (9.5 becomes 9.50, 9.999 becomes 10.00 with rounding).",

      explanation: "Nested conversions work from the inside out. float('3.7') converts the string '3.7' to the float 3.7, then int(3.7) converts the float to an integer by truncating (discarding) the decimal part, producing 3. Note that int() truncates toward zero, it does not round. If you need rounding, use round() first: int(round(3.7)) produces 4.

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The str() function converts the float to its full string representation, preserving all digits. str(3.14159) produces '3.14159'. Unlike format specifiers that control decimal places (:.2f), str() simply converts whatever value you provide to its string form without rounding or truncating. If you want to control decimal places, use f-strings: f'{3.14159:.2f}' produces '3.14'. str() always succeeds with numbers, making it safe for converting any numeric value for display or concatenation.",

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "For numeric types, the truthiness rule is: zero is False, all other values are True. bool(0.0) returns False because 0.0 is the float representation of zero. Similarly, bool(0) returns False. Any non-zero number is True: bool(0.1) is True, bool(-5) is True, bool(999) is True. This is why you can write if number: to check if a number is non-zero.

Similarly, float('  3.14  ') works. However, whitespace in the middle causes errors: int('4 2') raises ValueError. While int() handles edge whitespace, using strip() explicitly is clearer and works consistently across different conversion functions. Best practice: always clean input with strip() before conversion to ensure predictable behavior.",

Without this check, calling int('abc') raises ValueError, crashing your program. The pattern is: clean with strip(), validate with isdigit(), then convert with int(). This graceful error handling shows professionalism—instead of crashes, you provide helpful error messages. Validation-first thinking is essential for robust production code.",

This is more convenient than calculating the last index manually: text[len(text) - 1]. Negative indexing works with all sequences in Python (strings, lists, tuples). text[-1] is a common idiom for accessing the last element.

      explanation: "String operators follow standard precedence: * (repetition) before + (concatenation). 'hi' * 3 produces 'hihihi', then + '!' produces 'hihihi!'. To include the '!' in each repetition, you'd need: ('hi' + '!') * 3, which produces 'hi!hi!hi!'. Understanding operator precedence helps you predict results and write expressions correctly.

'hello world'[0:5] extracts characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index 5, producing 'hello' (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The space at index 5 is not included. Slicing is powerful for extracting substrings. You can omit start (defaults to 0): text[:5] is the same as text[0:5]. You can omit end (defaults to length): text[6:] gives 'world'.

Note that replace() is case-sensitive and operates on the result of lower(), not the original string.

'apple,banana'.split(',') produces the list ['apple', 'banana'], then [1] accesses the second element (index 1), which is 'banana'. This is a common pattern for parsing delimited data and extracting specific fields. Note that [0] would return 'apple'.
