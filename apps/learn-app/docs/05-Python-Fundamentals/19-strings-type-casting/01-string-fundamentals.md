# String Fundamentals — Creating and Understanding Text

If you've ever typed a message, filled out a form, or read a name on a screen, you've encountered strings. A **string** is Python's way of handling text data—from single letters to entire documents. Strings are everywhere in programs: usernames, error messages, filenames, addresses. Understanding how strings work is essential because nearly every program you write will work with text.

In this lesson, you'll learn to create strings, understand why Python treats them as unchangeable data, and practice accessing individual characters and combining strings together. By the end, you'll have the foundational skills to work confidently with text in Python.

## What Are Strings?

A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Think of it like a line of text written down—each character (letter, number, space, punctuation) sits in a specific position.

Here's the simplest possible string:

```python
name: str = "Alice"
```

The word `Alice` is a string. In Python, we tell the type system this is a string by writing `str` after the colon.

**Three Ways to Create Strings**

Python gives you three ways to write strings, and they all work the same way. The choice depends on what characters are in your string:

**Single quotes** work perfectly for most strings:

```python
greeting: str = 'Hello'
city: str = 'New York'
```

**Double quotes** are useful when your string contains a single quote (apostrophe):

```python
message: str = "It's a beautiful day"
possessive: str = "Mary's laptop"
```

**Triple quotes** let you write strings across multiple lines:

```python
address: str = """
123 Main Street
Anytown, State 12345
"""
```

All three produce strings. The quotes are just notation—they don't become part of the string itself. Once Python reads them, `Alice`, `Alice`, and `Alice` are identical strings.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

## String Immutability: Strings Don't Change

Here's a concept that surprises many beginners: **strings are immutable**. That means once you create a string, you cannot change it. Ever.

Let's see what this means in practice:

```python
text: str = "hello"

# If you try to change the first character:
# text[0] = "H"  # This causes an error!
```

If you run that code, Python gives an error: `TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment`. This error is telling you: "You can't modify a string that way."

**So how do you change text?** You create a new string:

```python
text: str = "hello"

# Instead of changing text, create a NEW string by adding to it
new_text: str = text + "!"  # Returns a NEW string: "hello!"

# Original is unchanged
print(f"Original: {text}")     # Still "hello"
print(f"New text: {new_text}") # New string: "hello!"
```

Notice the key difference: when you use `+` to combine strings, you create a brand new string. The original `text` stays exactly as it was. If you want to keep that new string, you must save it in a variable.

**Why does this matter?** Immutability makes strings predictable and safe. Once you create a string, you know it will never secretly change. This is a design choice Python makes to prevent bugs and confusion.

#### Specification and Validation

**Specification (What We Want)**:
- Create a string
- Apply an operation (concatenation)
- Validate original is unchanged

**Generated Code Example**:
```python
original: str = "Python"
modified: str = original + " Programming"

# Validation: Check that original is still "Python"
assert original == "Python", "Original should be unchanged"
assert modified == "Python Programming", "Modified should include added text"
print(f"Original preserved: {original == 'Python'}")  # True
```

**Validation Steps/Results**:
- Created original string `"Python"` ✓
- Applied concatenation operation with `+` ✓
- Confirmed original is unchanged ✓
- New string contains combined text ✓

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize the exact error message. Instead, understand the principle: strings are immutable. When you encounter errors like "str object does not support item assignment," ask your AI: "Why can't I change this string?" This reinforces the concept and helps you design better data flows.

## Accessing Individual Characters: Indexing and Length

Strings are sequences, which means each character sits in a specific position. You can access individual characters and count them.

**Positions start at 0:**

```python
text: str = "Python"
# P is at position 0
# y is at position 1
# t is at position 2
# ... and so on
```

To get a character at a specific position, use **indexing** with square brackets:

```python
word: str = "Python"

first_char: str = word[0]   # 'P' (first character)
second_char: str = word[1]  # 'y' (second character)
third_char: str = word[2]   # 't' (third character)
```

**Getting the last character** is common, and Python makes it easy with negative indices:

```python
word: str = "Python"

last_char: str = word[-1]   # 'n' (last character)
second_last: str = word[-2] # 'o' (second to last)
```

### Python's Built-in Functions: Introducing `len()`

Python provides **built-in functions** that work on many different types of data. These are tools Python gives you automatically—you don't need to import or create them. They're just ready to use.

One essential built-in function is **`len()`**, which counts items:
- For strings: counts characters
- For lists (you'll learn these later): counts items
- For other types: counts elements

**Using `len()` to count characters:**

```python
word: str = "Python"
length: int = len(word)  # Returns 6 (six characters)

print(f"The word '{word}' has {length} characters")
```

**Important distinction**: `len()` is a **built-in function**, not a string method. Notice the syntax:
- Built-in function: `len(word)` — you pass the string TO the function
- String method (you'll learn these in Lesson 2): `word.method()` — you call the method ON the string

Notice that `len()` returns an integer, not a string. This is important: `len()` counts characters and tells you the total, which is useful for validation and checking string size.

```python
name: str = "Alice"
char_count: int = len(name)  # 5

print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Length: {char_count}")
print(f"First character: {name[0]}")
print(f"Last character: {name[-1]}")
```

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Show me code that takes a person's name as a string and prints out each character on a separate line. Then explain what position (index) each character is at."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see how indexing and iteration work together, and you'll understand that each position in a string is accessible by its number.

## Basic Operations: Putting Strings Together

Two simple operations let you build larger strings from smaller ones: **concatenation** (joining) and **repetition** (repeating).

**Concatenation with `+`:**

```python
first_name: str = "Alice"
last_name: str = "Smith"

full_name: str = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # "Alice Smith"
```

Notice we added a space string `" "` in the middle. Without it, the result would be `"AliceSmith"` with no gap.

**Repetition with `*`:**

```python
separator: str = "-" * 20
print(separator)  # "--------------------"

welcome: str = "Welcome! " * 3
print(welcome)  # "Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! "
```

The `*` operator repeats a string a given number of times. This is useful for creating dividers, patterns, or repeated messages.

**Practical example—building a greeting:**

```python
name: str = "Bob"
greeting: str = "Hello, " + name + "!"

print(greeting)  # "Hello, Bob!"
```

Later in this chapter, you'll learn **f-strings**, which make this kind of building much easier. But the foundation—understanding concatenation—remains the same.


## Type Validation: Checking for Strings

Before you operate on a string, it's good practice to verify that your variable actually contains a string. This prevents confusing errors later.

Use **`isinstance()`** to check if something is a string:

```python
user_input: str = "hello"
number: int = 42

if isinstance(user_input, str):
    print("This is a string!")

if isinstance(number, str):
    print("This is NOT printed (number is int, not str)")
```

You can also use **`type()`** to see exactly what type a variable is:

```python
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 25

print(f"Type of name: {type(name)}")    # <class 'str'>
print(f"Type of age: {type(age)}")      # <class 'int'>
```

**Practical validation pattern:**

```python
user_input: str = "hello"

# Check BEFORE operating
if isinstance(user_input, str):
    greeting: str = "Welcome, " + user_input + "!"
    print(f"Greeting: {greeting}")
else:
    print("Input is not a string, cannot process")
```

This pattern—describe intent with type hints (`user_input: str`), then validate at runtime with `isinstance()`—is foundational to AI-native development. It's how you tell Python "I expect this to be a string" and then confirm it before using it.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> Syntax is cheap—validation is gold. Python syntax for isinstance() is simple, but the mindset is powerful: always validate your data before operating on it. This habit will save you hours debugging mysterious errors where a string operation fails because the variable was actually an integer.

## Summary of Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **String Literals** | Text enclosed in quotes | `"hello"`, `'hello'`, `"""multiline"""` |
| **Immutability** | Strings cannot be changed; operations return new strings | `text + "!"` creates new string, original unchanged |
| **Indexing** | Access a character by position (0-based) | `text[0]` gets first character; `text[-1]` gets last |
| **len()** | Built-in function that counts characters in a string | `len("Python")` returns 6 |
| **Concatenation** | Join strings with `+` | `"Hello " + "World"` = `"Hello World"` |
| **Repetition** | Repeat a string with `*` | `"*" * 5` = `"*****"` |
| **isinstance()** | Check if something is a string | `isinstance("text", str)` returns True |
