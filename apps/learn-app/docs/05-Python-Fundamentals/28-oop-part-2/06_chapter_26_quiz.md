  questions={[    {
      question: "You have a class hierarchy: Vehicle → Car → SportsCar. When SportsCar calls super().__init__(), what happens if Car forgets to call super().__init__()?",
      options: [
        "Vehicle's __init__ is never executed and attributes missing",
        "Python automatically calls Vehicle's __init__ anyway using reflection",
        "SportsCar initialization fails with immediate AttributeError at instantiation",
        "Car's __init__ executes but Vehicle attributes use default values"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. When Car forgets to call super().__init__(), the initialization chain breaks. SportsCar calls Car's __init__ via super(), but Car never calls Vehicle's __init__(), so Vehicle's attributes are never set. This creates objects with missing attributes that fail at runtime when accessed. Option 2 is false—Python doesn't automatically call parent constructors. Option 3 is incorrect because instantiation succeeds; the error occurs later when code tries to access Vehicle attributes. Option 4 is wrong—there are no default values; the attributes simply don't exist. This demonstrates why proper super() chains are critical in multi-level inheritance, covered in Lesson 1.",

    {
      question: "Given this diamond inheritance: class D(B, C) where both B and C inherit from A, what is the Method Resolution Order for class D?",
      options: [
        "D → B → A → C → object violates C3 linearization consistency",
        "D → B → C → A → object order maintains left parent priority",
        "D → A → B → C → object ensures base comes first",
        "D → C → B → A → object because right parent wins"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Python's C3 linearization algorithm produces MRO: D → B → C → A → object. This order satisfies three principles: (1) subclasses before parents, (2) inheritance order preserved (B before C as listed in class D(B, C)), and (3) no class appears twice. Option 2 is wrong—A appears after both B and C, not between them. Option 3 violates the inheritance order preservation rule—B must come before C. Option 4 is backwards—left parent (B) takes priority over right parent (C). Understanding MRO prevents method call confusion in multiple inheritance scenarios, as explained in Lesson 1 with the C3 linearization algorithm.",

    },
    {
      question: "You're building a multi-agent system with BaseAgent, ChatMixin, and ToolMixin. You want ChatMixin's process() method to execute first. How do you structure the inheritance?",
      options: [
        "class SmartAgent(ToolMixin, ChatMixin, BaseAgent) gives ToolMixin the execution priority",
        "class SmartAgent(BaseAgent, ChatMixin, ToolMixin) ensures BaseAgent has priority control",
        "class SmartAgent(ChatMixin, ToolMixin, BaseAgent) puts ChatMixin first in MRO",
        "Inheritance order doesn't matter because Python searches alphabetically by name"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. In Python's MRO, classes are searched left-to-right as listed in the inheritance declaration. class SmartAgent(ChatMixin, ToolMixin, BaseAgent) produces MRO: SmartAgent → ChatMixin → ToolMixin → BaseAgent → object. When process() is called, Python finds ChatMixin's version first and executes it. Option 2 would give BaseAgent priority (wrong if you want ChatMixin first). Option 3 would give ToolMixin priority. Option 4 is completely false—Python never searches alphabetically; it uses explicit MRO based on inheritance order. This demonstrates how mixin order controls capability precedence in professional agent architectures, covered in Lesson 1's MRO section.",

    {
      question: "When asking AI to implement a three-level inheritance hierarchy (Animal → Mammal → Dog), which prompt structure produces the most maintainable code?",
      options: [
        "Tell AI to avoid super() and directly initialize all attributes",
        "Ask AI to write all three classes without explaining inheritance relationships",
        "Specify exact line-by-line implementation for each constructor to avoid errors",
        "Describe each level's unique attributes and all levels' super() requirements clearly"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 4. The best AI prompt describes intent and requirements: 'Animal has name, Mammal adds fur_color, Dog adds breed. Each level should call super().__init__() properly.' This lets AI generate correct initialization chains while understanding the design. Option 2 produces fragile code—without context, AI might forget super() or misunderstand attribute ownership. Option 3 is too prescriptive and prevents AI from applying best practices (like using super() correctly). Option 4 actively requests bad code—skipping super() breaks initialization chains in multi-level hierarchies. Effective AI collaboration for inheritance requires explaining the conceptual hierarchy, not micromanaging syntax, as emphasized in Lesson 1's AI collaboration sections.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Inheritance and Method Resolution Order"
    },
    {
      question: "You inspect a class's MRO and see: [SmartAgent, ChatMixin, ToolMixin, BaseAgent, object]. If ChatMixin and BaseAgent both have execute() methods, which one gets called?",
      options: [
        "ChatMixin's execute() because it appears earlier in the MRO search sequence",
        "BaseAgent's execute() because base classes have priority over mixin classes",
        "Python raises AmbiguousMethodError requiring you to specify which to call",
        "Both execute() methods run sequentially in the order they appear"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Python searches the MRO left-to-right and stops at the first class that defines the method. Since ChatMixin appears before BaseAgent in the MRO, ChatMixin's execute() is found and called. BaseAgent's execute() is never reached unless ChatMixin explicitly calls super().execute(). Option 2 is false—Python has no concept of 'base class priority'; only MRO order matters. Option 3 is wrong—Python never raises ambiguity errors; MRO deterministically resolves all method lookups. Option 4 misunderstands method resolution—only one method executes unless explicitly chained with super(). This is why MRO order matters critically in multi-capability agent systems, as explained in Lesson 1.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Inheritance and Method Resolution Order"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the key difference between method overriding and method overloading in Python?",
      options: [
        "Overloading changes method names while overriding keeps the same method name",
        "Python supports overriding but not traditional overloading with multiple signatures",
        "Overriding is compile-time while overloading is runtime behavior in Python",
        "Overloading requires @override decorator while overriding needs @overload marker"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Python fully supports method overriding (child class replaces parent method with same name), but doesn't support traditional overloading (multiple methods with same name but different signatures like Java/C++). Python uses default arguments and *args/**kwargs for parameter flexibility instead of overloading. Option 2 is backwards—overriding keeps the same name, and overloading (if it existed) would too. Option 3 confuses concepts—both would be runtime in Python, which is dynamically typed. Option 4 invents non-existent decorators—@override doesn't enforce anything in standard Python (it's documentation), and @overload is from typing module for type hints only, not actual overloading. This distinction is foundational for understanding polymorphism in Lesson 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Polymorphism and Duck Typing"
    },
    {
      question: "You create an abstract base class Agent with @abstractmethod process(). What happens if you try to instantiate Agent directly?",
      options: [
        "Python issues a warning but allows instantiation for testing purposes",
        "Object is created but process() raises NotImplementedError when called later",
        "Python raises TypeError at instantiation preventing object creation immediately",
        "Abstract methods are automatically implemented with empty pass statements"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. Abstract Base Classes with @abstractmethod prevent instantiation at the class level. Calling Agent() immediately raises TypeError: 'Can't instantiate abstract class Agent with abstract method process'. This catches errors early (at object creation) rather than late (at method call). Option 2 describes the old pattern of raising NotImplementedError in method bodies—less safe because the error occurs at runtime, not instantiation. Option 3 is false—Python strictly prevents ABC instantiation, no warnings. Option 4 misunderstands @abstractmethod—abstract methods have no default implementation; subclasses must provide concrete implementations. This enforcement mechanism is why ABCs are superior to informal base classes, as explained in Lesson 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Polymorphism and Duck Typing"
    },
    {
      question: "When reviewing AI-generated code with inheritance, you see: class Dog(Animal): def __init__(self, name): self.name = name. What's the likely problem?",
      options: [
        "Name parameter should be *args to allow Animal flexibility in future",
        "The constructor should use __new__ instead of __init__ for proper inheritance",
        "Dog needs to explicitly list all Animal attributes in its constructor",
        "Dog's __init__ doesn't call super().__init__() so Animal initialization is skipped"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 4. The Dog constructor sets self.name but never calls super().__init__(), meaning Animal's initialization logic is skipped. If Animal sets attributes like self.species or performs setup, those never happen for Dog instances. You should request AI to add super().__init__(name) as the first line. Option 2 is wrong—__new__ is rarely needed and isn't the issue here. Option 3 misunderstands inheritance—Dog shouldn't re-implement Animal's attributes; it should call super() to let Animal handle its own. Option 4 is over-engineering—the issue is missing super(), not parameter flexibility. Recognizing missing super() calls is a critical code review skill for AI-generated inheritance hierarchies, emphasized in Lesson 1 and 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Polymorphism and Duck Typing"
    },
    {
      question: "In duck typing, when would a function expecting an object with read() method fail, even if the object has that method?",
      options: [
        "Duck typing always works if the method name matches exactly",
        "The read() method exists but has wrong signature like read(self, count, offset)",
        "Python checks method signatures at import time and rejects mismatches",
        "The object's class must inherit from Readable protocol for validation"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Duck typing checks method existence, not method signatures. If your function calls reader.read() (no arguments) but the object's read() requires read(self, count, offset), the call fails with TypeError: missing required arguments. The method exists, but the signature doesn't match the expected interface. Option 2 is false—method name matching isn't sufficient; the signature must also be compatible. Option 3 is wrong—Python doesn't check signatures at import time (it's dynamically typed). Option 4 misunderstands duck typing—the whole point is NOT requiring inheritance from protocols or interfaces. This signature mismatch is a common duck typing failure mode, as explained in Lesson 2's duck typing section.",

    {
      question: "You have PaymentProcessor ABC and three subclasses: CreditCard, PayPal, Crypto. You ask AI to add a logging feature to all processors. What's the best approach?",
      options: [
        "Add log() method to PaymentProcessor base class so all inherit automatically",
        "Ask AI to add identical log() implementation to each of three subclasses",
        "Use duck typing and manually add log() to whichever class needs it",
        "Create a separate Logger class and pass it as parameter to each"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Adding log() to the PaymentProcessor abstract base class makes it immediately available to all subclasses through inheritance. This is the primary benefit of ABC-based polymorphism—shared functionality automatically propagates. No code duplication, one implementation, consistent behavior. Option 2 is maintainability nightmare—three duplicate implementations, three places to update when logging changes. Option 3 sacrifices the benefit of inheritance—duck typing is great for flexibility, but here you have a clear hierarchy where shared behavior makes sense. Option 4 is over-engineering—composition via Logger makes sense for complex logging strategies, but simple logging belongs in the base class. This demonstrates when ABC provides clear value over duck typing, covered in Lesson 2.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Polymorphism and Duck Typing"
    },
    {
      question: "When would duck typing be preferable to using an Abstract Base Class for a file reader interface?",
      options: [
        "When you need to enforce that all readers implement required methods",
        "When you need compile-time type checking with mypy for safety guarantees",
        "When all reader implementations are in your codebase under your control",
        "When readers come from external libraries you don't control and can't modify"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 4. Duck typing shines when you're integrating with third-party libraries (like csv, json, io modules) that weren't designed to inherit from your ABC. If they have a read() method, duck typing lets you use them without wrapper classes or inheritance gymnastics. Option 2 is backwards—ABCs enable better type checking, not duck typing. Option 3 favors ABC (you control the code so you can enforce the contract). Option 4 also favors ABC—enforcement is ABC's strength, not duck typing's. The key insight: duck typing provides flexibility to work with external code you can't modify, while ABC provides enforcement for code you control. This trade-off is central to Lesson 2's design decision framework.",

    {
      question: "You ask AI: 'Create a dispatcher for ChatAgent, CodeAgent, DataAgent without isinstance() checks.' What design pattern should AI use?",
      options: [
        "Singleton pattern to ensure only one dispatcher exists in the system",
        "Factory pattern to create agents and dictionary mapping types to handlers",
        "Polymorphism with common base class so dispatcher calls agent.process() for all",
        "Strategy pattern to encapsulate dispatch algorithms for each agent type"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. Polymorphism eliminates isinstance() checks by using a common interface (Agent base class with process() method). The dispatcher simply calls agent.process(message) regardless of concrete type—Python's method resolution handles the rest. Option 2 describes Factory (creating agents), not dispatching (routing to agents). Option 3 describes Singleton (single instance), irrelevant to eliminating type checks. Option 4 misapplies Strategy—Strategy is for swappable algorithms, not for avoiding type checks in dispatch. The core insight: polymorphism makes all agents look the same to the dispatcher, eliminating the need for type-specific logic. This is the fundamental value proposition of polymorphism, emphasized throughout Lesson 2.",

      question: "A Car has an Engine. An Employee has a Printer capability. Which statement correctly identifies the relationships?",
      options: [
        "Car has-a Engine is composition, Employee has-a PrinterCapability is composition too",
        "Both are inheritance because Car is-a Engine and Employee is-a Printer",
        "Car has-a Engine is aggregation, Employee has-a Printer is inheritance relationship",
        "Car should inherit from Engine and Employee should compose a Printer"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Both are composition ('has-a' relationships). A Car contains an Engine object and delegates engine operations to it. An Employee contains a PrinterCapability (or printing behavior) but isn't a Printer. Neither relationship is inheritance (is-a). Option 2 is completely wrong—Car is NOT an Engine, Employee is NOT a Printer. These are textbook examples of composition, not inheritance. Option 3 misidentifies the Employee/Printer relationship as inheritance—employees aren't printers. Option 4 is backwards—inheritance from Engine makes no sense (Car isn't an Engine type), and composition of Printer is correct but contradicts the recommended approach. This distinction between has-a (composition) and is-a (inheritance) is foundational, covered in Lesson 3.",

        "Inheritance allows more code reuse and eliminates duplication across all bird classes",
        "Composition lets birds have or not have flying without forcing rigid hierarchy",
        "Flying requires multiple inheritance which composition cannot provide in Python effectively",
        "Composition makes bird classes immutable while inheritance allows attribute modification freely"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Composition solves the penguin problem—not all birds fly. With composition, you give flying birds a Flyer object and non-flying birds (penguins) None or a Swimmer. With inheritance (all birds inherit from FlyingBird), penguins break the Liskov Substitution Principle. Composition provides flexibility to mix capabilities without rigid hierarchies. Option 2 is backwards—composition often involves more code initially but provides better long-term flexibility and avoids inheritance fragility. Option 3 is irrelevant—multiple inheritance works in Python but isn't the reason to use composition. Option 4 is nonsense—composition has nothing to do with immutability. The 'composition over inheritance' principle is a hard-learned industry lesson, detailed in Lesson 3.",

      question: "What's the key difference between composition and aggregation in terms of object lifetime?",

        "Aggregation is faster because it uses pointers instead of composition's deep copying",
        "Aggregation requires manual memory management while composition uses garbage collection automatically",
        "Composition allows multiple containers while aggregation enforces single ownership strictly",
        "Composition means container owns object, aggregation means container just references it"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 4. Composition implies strong ownership—when a Car is destroyed, its Engine is destroyed (the Car created and owns the Engine). Aggregation implies weak relationship—when a University closes, its Departments can exist independently (University references but doesn't own Departments). Option 2 is irrelevant—Python's garbage collection handles both equally; the distinction is conceptual, not memory management. Option 3 is backwards—composition often means single ownership, aggregation allows sharing. Option 4 is completely wrong—Python doesn't expose pointers, and neither pattern does deep copying by default. Understanding this lifetime distinction helps design appropriate object relationships, as explained in Lesson 3.",

      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. A package (agents/ directory) with __init__.py and separate module files (chat.py, code.py, data.py) provides logical organization, clear namespace, and scalability. The __init__.py controls the public API via imports and __all__. Option 2 doesn't scale—as the system grows, a single file becomes unwieldy and hard to navigate. Option 3 is over-engineering—each agent doesn't need its own package; that adds unnecessary nesting. Option 4 pollutes the root directory and uses poor naming (prefix-based organization instead of package hierarchy). This package structure follows Python conventions and enables modular growth, as demonstrated in Lesson 3's module organization section.",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. __all__ = ['Dog', 'Cat'] in animals/__init__.py controls what gets imported when someone writes from animals import *. Only Dog and Cat are imported, even if other classes exist in the package. This lets you define a clean public API while keeping internal helpers private. Option 2 is false—nothing is automatically instantiated; __all__ only controls import behavior. Option 3 misunderstands Python imports—all modules in an __init__.py are imported when the package is imported (unless you use lazy imports explicitly, unrelated to __all__). Option 4 confuses class methods with package exports—__all__ is at the package level, not class level. This controls the public package interface, explained in Lesson 3.",

      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. The best AI prompt explains the problem ('Penguin inherits fly() but penguins can't fly'), requests the pattern ('use composition with capabilities'), and provides guidance ('birds have Flyer or Swimmer objects, delegate operations to them'). This gives AI context to generate appropriate solutions. Option 2 lacks context—AI doesn't know WHY inheritance is wrong, so it might produce equally flawed composition. Option 3 is contradictory—composition fundamentally changes class structure; you can't 'keep the same structure.' Option 4 misuses aggregation—not all relationships should be weak; some should be strong ownership (composition).

      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. __str__ returns human-readable output for end users (print(obj) shows this). __repr__ returns developer-friendly representation for debugging (repr(obj) and interactive shell show this). Convention: __repr__ should ideally return valid Python code to recreate the object like Person(name='Alice', age=30). Option 2 misunderstands their purpose—both return strings, and __str__ is what print() calls, not concatenation specifically. Option 3 is irrelevant—performance difference is negligible; the distinction is semantic (user vs developer audience).

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 4. Returning NotImplemented (not raising TypeError) tells Python 'I don't know how to handle this operation.' Python then tries the reverse operation (__radd__ on the other operand). If both return NotImplemented, Python raises TypeError. This enables symmetric operations where either operand can handle the addition. Option 2 is wrong—NotImplemented is specifically for special methods to enable fallback behavior. Option 3 misunderstands the protocol—both __add__ and __radd__ should return NotImplemented for unsupported types. Option 4 confuses exception types—NotImplemented is NOT an exception; it's a signal to Python's operator dispatch system. This pattern enables flexible operator overloading, covered in Lesson 4.",

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Implementing __len__ and __getitem__ makes the Playlist behave like a sequence. Python automatically enables iteration (for song in playlist), indexing (playlist[0]), and slicing (playlist[1:3]). This is the Container protocol—once __getitem__ works, iteration comes for free. Option 2 is false—__getitem__ doesn't sort; it just provides access to underlying storage in whatever order you defined. Option 3 is unrelated—special methods have nothing to do with immutability or thread safety. Option 4 is also unrelated—lazy loading is a separate design pattern, not something __getitem__ provides.

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Python's sets and dictionaries use hash values for fast lookup. If two objects compare equal (__eq__ returns True), they MUST have the same hash value, or they'll be treated as different in sets/dicts, breaking the data structure semantics. If Person(name='Alice', age=30) == Person(name='Alice', age=30), both must have identical hash(). Option 2 is backwards—Python makes objects unhashable if you define __eq__ without __hash__ to prevent this exact inconsistency.

For Countdown(5), after yielding 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, the next call to __next__ should raise StopIteration to signal 'no more values.' Python's for loop catches this exception and terminates the loop cleanly. Option 2 confuses error handling—errors during iteration raise their specific exceptions (ValueError, etc.), not StopIteration. Option 3 is arbitrary nonsense—there's no 1000-iteration limit; StopIteration is based on your iterator's logic.

      options: [
        "Protocol enables structural typing without requiring explicit inheritance from base",
        "Protocol provides better runtime performance because it skips method validation checks",
        "Protocol automatically implements missing methods unlike ABC which requires manual implementation",
        "Protocol works in Python 2.7 while ABC requires Python 3.4 or later"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. typing.Protocol enables structural subtyping (duck typing with type checking). If a class has the right methods (process(), get_status()), it satisfies the Protocol—no inheritance required. ABCs require explicit inheritance (class ChatAgent(Agent)). Protocol gives duck typing's flexibility with type checker validation. Option 2 is false—Protocols are for static type checking (mypy), not runtime performance. Option 3 is backwards—neither auto-implements methods; both require manual implementation. Option 4 is wrong—Protocol was added in Python 3.8; ABC has been in Python much longer (2.6+). Protocols bridge duck typing and type safety, discussed briefly in Lesson 2's polymorphism alternatives.",

      question: "In a Factory with agent type registry, what's the benefit of allowing agent classes to self-register?",

        "Factory memory usage is reduced by lazy-loading only registered agents from",
        "New agents can be added by importing files, no factory modification needed"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 4. Self-registration pattern: each agent file has AgentFactory.register('chat', ChatAgent) at the bottom. When the file is imported, the agent registers itself. To add new agent types, just create the file and import it—no factory modification needed. This follows the open/closed principle perfectly. Option 2 is false—registration and ABC validation are separate concerns. Option 3 misunderstands the pattern—memory usage is unaffected; all code loads on import anyway. Option 4 is irrelevant—self-registration is about adding to the factory registry, not about constructor parameters. Self-registration enables truly pluggable architecture, an advanced Factory pattern technique mentioned in Lesson 5.",

      question: "When implementing __iter__ and __next__ for a custom collection, what's a common mistake that breaks the iterator protocol?",
      options: [
        "Raising StopIteration too early prevents the last value from being yielded",
        "Implementing __next__ without __iter__ because Python infers __iter__ from __next__ automatically",
        "Forgetting to return self from __iter__ causes iteration to fail",
        "Using return instead of yield in __next__ works but is slower"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 3. The iterator protocol requires __iter__ to return an iterator object (usually self). If __iter__ returns None or nothing, for loops fail with TypeError: iter() returned non-iterator. This is a common beginner mistake. Option 2 is false—Python doesn't infer __iter__; you must implement both. Option 3 misunderstands the protocol—StopIteration should be raised after the last value is yielded, not before. Option 4 confuses generators (which use yield) with manual iterators (which use return in __next__ to return values and raise StopIteration when done). Understanding the complete iterator protocol prevents these mistakes, covered in Lesson 4's iteration section.",

      question: "You're refactoring tight coupling in agent creation where every module directly imports and instantiates ChatAgent, CodeAgent, DataAgent. Which pattern addresses this?",
      options: [
        "Factory pattern centralizes agent creation, modules request agents from factory",
        "Singleton pattern ensures each module gets the same agent instances always",
        "Observer pattern eliminates imports by using event-based agent creation instead",
        "Strategy pattern provides different agent creation algorithms based on module needs"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Factory pattern solves tight coupling to concrete classes. Instead of from agents import ChatAgent; agent = ChatAgent(), modules do from factory import AgentFactory; agent = AgentFactory.create_agent('chat'). Modules depend only on the factory interface, not specific agent classes. This decoupling enables changing agent implementations without modifying all consumer code. Option 2 addresses instance sharing, not creation coupling. Option 3 is convoluted—Observer is for communication, not creation decoupling. Option 4 misapplies Strategy—creation logic isn't the algorithm that varies. Factory is the standard decoupling pattern for object creation, thoroughly explained in Lesson 5.",

      question: "What's the key difference between aggregation and composition in terms of object ownership semantics?",
      options: [
        "Aggregation uses pass-by-value while composition uses pass-by-reference in Python",
        "Composition implies strong ownership where container owns contained object",
        "Composition allows shared objects across containers while aggregation enforces uniqueness",
        "Aggregation is faster because it uses weak references for garbage collection"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 2. Composition means the container creates and owns the contained object (Car creates its Engine)—strong coupling, shared lifetime. Aggregation means the container references but doesn't own the object (University references Departments)—weak coupling, independent lifetimes. When a Car is destroyed, its Engine is destroyed. When a University closes, Departments can continue independently. Option 2 is nonsense—Python always uses references, not value copying, and that's orthogonal to composition/aggregation semantics. Option 3 is backwards—composition typically means single ownership, aggregation allows sharing. Option 4 confuses implementation details with semantic relationships. Understanding ownership semantics guides architectural decisions, explained in Lesson 3.",

      question: "When would you implement __repr__ but not __str__ for a class?",

        "Never, Python requires both or neither to maintain consistency between them"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. If a class is primarily internal (not user-facing), implementing just __repr__ makes sense. Python falls back to __repr__ when __str__ is missing, so print(obj) will use __repr__. Implementing only __repr__ that returns recreatable representation (like Point(x=3, y=5)) serves both debugging and basic display needs. Option 2 confuses immutability with string representation needs—immutability doesn't determine whether you need __str__. Option 3 is irrelevant—__str__ performance overhead is negligible. Option 4 is false—you can implement only __repr__, and Python uses it for both contexts. Understanding when __repr__ alone suffices simplifies class design, mentioned in Lesson 4.",

      question: "In Observer pattern, what problem arises if observers directly modify the subject during notification?",
      options: [
        "Iterating over observer list while modifying it causes runtime errors",
        "Subject state becomes inconsistent because notifications are out of order",
        "Observer pattern requires immutable subjects so modification is prevented automatically",
        "Python's GIL prevents modifications during iteration for thread safety enforcement"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. If an observer's update() method calls subject.detach(self) during notification, the subject modifies its _observers list while iterating over it in notify(). This causes RuntimeError: list changed during iteration. Solutions: (1) iterate over a copy of the list, (2) collect detach requests and apply after iteration, or (3) use a more sophisticated observer management mechanism. Option 2 misidentifies the problem—state consistency is a separate concern from iteration errors. Option 3 is false—Observer pattern has no immutability requirement. Option 4 misunderstands GIL—it doesn't prevent this error; the issue is mutating a list during iteration, not thread safety. This is a classic Observer implementation gotcha, mentioned in Lesson 5.",
