  questions={[    {
      question: "When debugging a multi-condition eligibility check, you discover users with age 85 and valid payment are denied. What's the most likely cause?",
      options: [
        "The condition uses or instead of and operator",
        "The elif chain has an unreachable age condition",
        "The age range check excludes upper boundary incorrectly",
        "The nested if statement has wrong indentation level"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that the age range check excludes the upper boundary incorrectly. When checking age ranges like age >= 18 and age &lt; 65, a boundary error means valid ages like 85 fall outside the range even when they should be included. Option 1 (or vs and) would cause over-acceptance, not denial. Option 2 (unreachable condition) wouldn't specifically target boundary ages. Option 4 (indentation) would cause syntax errors or different logic paths entirely. Boundary errors are common in range validation—always test edge values. When working with AI, clearly specify inclusive/exclusive boundaries: 'age 18-120 inclusive' prevents this error class. This debugging pattern appears when conditional logic excludes valid inputs at range boundaries.",

      question: "You're processing API responses with varying structure. Which approach correctly handles missing keys without crashing?",
      options: [
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is checking if key in dict before accessing. This conditional pattern safely verifies key existence before attempting access, preventing KeyError without exception handling overhead. Option 1 (try-except) works but is more complex and slower for expected scenarios (you'll learn exceptions in Chapter 25). Option 2 (match-case) can't directly match dict keys as patterns—it requires exact value matching, not membership testing. Option 3 (type checking) doesn't address the missing key problem. The 'if key in dict' pattern is Pythonic, efficient, and clear: it explicitly states 'check before use.' When describing this to AI, say 'verify key exists before accessing' rather than prescribing exception handling. This demonstrates defensive programming—validating assumptions before operations.",

    {
      question: "Why does this grade calculator always return 'F' even for score 95: if score >= 60: grade = 'F' elif score >= 90: grade = 'A'?",
      options: [
        "The elif condition is unreachable due to condition ordering",
        "The comparison operators are reversed in conditional logic",
        "The variable assignment happens before the condition check",
        "The indentation level causes incorrect block execution"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that the elif condition is unreachable due to ordering. When score is 95, the first condition score >= 60 is True, so grade gets 'F' and Python stops checking. The elif score >= 90 never executes because a previous condition already matched. This is the classic 'unreachable condition' error: checking broader ranges before specific ones. Option 1 (reversed operators) would cause different wrong behavior (all passing). Option 2 (assignment timing) doesn't affect conditional evaluation. Option 3 (indentation) would cause syntax errors. Fix: order conditions from most specific to least (90, then 80, then 70, then 60). When asking AI to generate grade logic, specify: 'check highest grade first, then lower grades.' Understanding condition order prevents silent logic bugs where code runs but produces wrong results.",

    {
      question: "When validating user input, you need to check: is_member AND (purchase > 50 OR has_coupon). Which structure expresses this most clearly?",
      options: [
        "Nested if checking membership first then purchase or coupon conditions",
        "Single if with parentheses combining conditions with logical operators",
        "Two separate if statements checking each condition independently",
        "Match-case statement matching the combined boolean result values"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is the single if with parentheses. Python evaluates (purchase > 50 or has_coupon) first due to parentheses, then checks is_member with that result. This reads exactly like the requirement: 'member AND (over 50 OR coupon).' Option 1 (nested if) works but requires two indentation levels, making the OR relationship less obvious. Option 2 (two separate ifs) breaks the combined logic into independent checks, losing the AND relationship. Option 3 (match-case) can't match complex boolean expressions—it's for exact value matching. Parentheses make operator precedence explicit: no ambiguity about what's checked first. When describing complex conditions to AI, use plain language with parentheses: 'if member AND (purchase over 50 OR has coupon).' This maps directly to Python's and/or syntax with explicit grouping.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Making Decisions with Conditionals"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the key difference between nested if statements and elif chains when handling related conditions?",
      options: [
        "Nested ifs require more memory for storing condition state",
        "Elif chains execute faster due to short-circuit evaluation",
        "Nested ifs check sub-conditions only when parent is True",
        "Elif chains allow combining unrelated conditions with logical operators"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is nested ifs check sub-conditions only when the parent is True. Nested structure means inner conditions aren't even evaluated unless outer conditions pass—this creates a decision tree. Elif chains, in contrast, check conditions sequentially at the same level until one matches. Option 1 (speed) is wrong—both use short-circuit evaluation; performance difference is negligible. Option 2 (memory) is incorrect—neither stores condition state differently. Option 3 (unrelated conditions) reverses the truth—elif chains are for mutually exclusive alternatives (same variable, different values), while nested ifs handle dependent conditions. Use nested ifs for hierarchical decisions ('if age valid, then if has license, then if insurance') and elif for alternatives ('if age &lt; 13 child, elif age &lt; 20 teen, elif age >= 20 adult'). When asking AI, describe the relationship: 'check X, if true then check Y' triggers nesting; 'check X or Y or Z' triggers elif chains.",

    {
      question: "You're building a command router with 15 valid commands. What's the main advantage of match-case over if-elif-else here?",
      options: [
        "Match-case prevents typos by enforcing exact string matching",
        "Match-case runs significantly faster for large command sets",
        "Match-case automatically handles invalid input with wildcard default",
        "Match-case structure shows all options clearly as decision table"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that match-case shows all options as a clear decision table. When you see 15 case statements in sequence, the structure immediately communicates 'here are all possible commands' in a scannable format. If-elif-else with 15 branches requires reading each condition ('if command == ..., elif command == ...'). Option 0 (typos) is wrong—both syntaxes enforce exact matching equally. Option 1 (speed) is incorrect—performance difference is minimal for typical use cases. Option 3 (wildcard default) misunderstands that else serves the same role as case _. The readability advantage matters for maintenance: adding a new command to match-case is visually obvious (add another case), while in if-elif chains you must find the right elif position. When asking AI to generate command routers, specify: 'use match-case for readability when comparing one variable against many values.' This improves code intent clarity.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Pattern Matching with match-case"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does this HTTP status handler fail: match status_code: case 200: ... case _: ... case 404: print('Not found')?",
      options: [
        "Wildcard pattern must be last in match-case statement",
        "Case 404 should be case '404' for string matching",
        "The match statement is missing the required colon character",
        "Multiple case statements require the or operator between values"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is wildcard pattern must be last. Once Python matches case _, it exits the match block—subsequent cases become unreachable dead code. Case 404 never executes because case _ already matched everything. Option 1 (string vs int) is irrelevant here—the pattern placement is the issue, not type matching. Option 2 (missing colon) would cause SyntaxError, not silent failure. Option 3 (or operator) refers to combining multiple values in one case (case 200 | 201:), which isn't the problem here. The fix: move case _ to the very end after all specific cases. When asking AI to generate match-case, specify: 'include wildcard default case last to handle unexpected values.' This prevents accidentally masking valid patterns with an early catch-all.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Pattern Matching with match-case"
    },
    {
      question: "When does match-case become less appropriate than if-elif-else for handling conditions?",
      options: [
        "When comparing one variable against multiple exact values",
        "When checking ranges like age >= 18 or score >= 90",
        "When the wildcard pattern needs to handle default cases",
        "When working with string values instead of integer values"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is when checking ranges. Match-case works with exact values (case 200:, case 'red':), not comparison operators (>= or &lt;). For grade ranges like 'if score >= 90' versus 'elif score >= 80', you must use if-elif because you're comparing, not matching. Option 0 (multiple exact values) is wrong—this is match-case's strength. Option 2 (wildcard) is incorrect—case _ works fine as a default, just like else. Option 3 (strings vs ints) doesn't matter—match-case handles both types equally. The key distinction: exact value matching (match-case) vs relational comparison (if-elif). When describing logic to AI, use 'match against these specific values' for match-case, or 'check if value is greater than / less than thresholds' for if-elif. Understanding this distinction prevents using the wrong pattern for the task.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Pattern Matching with match-case"
    },
    {
      question: "You ask AI to convert a 5-case if-elif chain to match-case. The generated code includes case 200 | 201 | 202. What does this syntax mean?",
      options: [
        "The pipe notation indicates optional matching for better error handling",
        "The vertical bar separates value from its corresponding action code",
        "The syntax creates a bitwise OR operation on HTTP status codes",
        "The pipe | operator combines multiple patterns as or alternatives"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is the pipe | combines multiple patterns as OR alternatives. Case 200 | 201 | 202 means 'if status_code is 200 OR 201 OR 202, execute this block.' This is more concise than three separate cases. Option 1 (separates value from action) misunderstands syntax—the colon separates pattern from block. Option 2 (bitwise OR) confuses operators—| in match-case is pattern OR, not bitwise math. Option 3 (optional matching) invents nonexistent semantics. The pipe syntax reduces code duplication: instead of case 200: print('Success') case 201: print('Success') case 202: print('Success'), you write case 200 | 201 | 202: print('Success'). When asking AI to generate match-case with similar handling, specify: 'group cases with same result using pipe syntax.' This produces cleaner, more maintainable code.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Pattern Matching with match-case"
    },
    {
      question: "When reviewing AI-generated match-case for a menu system, what indicates the code is using match-case appropriately?",
      options: [
        "The wildcard pattern is placed first to optimize performance",
        "The case patterns use comparison operators to check value ranges",
        "The match expression compares one variable to multiple exact string values",
        "The match statement includes complex boolean expressions with and or"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is matching one variable to multiple exact string values. This is match-case's sweet spot: comparing choice variable against 'save', 'load', 'quit', etc. Option 1 (comparison operators) is wrong—case patterns can't use >= or &lt;; those require if-elif. Option 2 (wildcard first) is incorrect—wildcard must be last or patterns become unreachable. Option 3 (complex booleans) misunderstands match-case—it's not for evaluating and/or expressions like if-elif handles. Appropriate match-case: one variable, many possible exact values, literal matching. Inappropriate: ranges, complex conditions, multiple variables. When asking AI: 'Use match-case when checking what value this variable equals; use if-elif when checking if conditions are true.' This ensures AI picks the right structure.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Pattern Matching with match-case"
    },
    {
      question: "You're processing paginated API responses where each page may have 0-100 items and total pages are unknown. Which loop structure handles this best?",
      options: [
        "For loop with range(1000) breaking when empty page found",
        "While loop checking if page has items and requesting next",
        "For loop iterating until StopIteration exception is raised explicitly",
        "Recursive function calling itself until no more pages returned"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is while loop checking for items. While loops excel at indefinite iteration—you don't know how many pages exist, but you know when to stop (empty page). The condition 'while page has items' naturally expresses the logic. Option 1 (for with range(1000)) works but uses arbitrary large number, which is fragile—what if 1001 pages exist? Option 2 (StopIteration) misuses exception handling for control flow—you'll learn exceptions in Chapter 25. Option 3 (recursion) risks stack overflow with many pages and is less idiomatic Python for iteration. When describing this to AI, say: 'loop while pages remain' or 'continue until empty page'—this maps directly to while loop condition. For loops work best when iteration count is known; while loops when iteration depends on runtime condition. Understanding this distinction guides loop type selection.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Repetition with Loops"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the most common cause of off-by-one errors when using range() in for loops?",
      options: [
        "Forgetting that range(start, stop) excludes the stop value",
        "Using one-indexed counting instead of zero-indexed counting",
        "Incrementing the loop variable manually inside the loop body",
        "Comparing loop variable with >= instead of > operator"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is forgetting range excludes stop. Range(1, 10) generates 1 through 9, not 10—Python's convention for slicing and ranges. To include 10, use range(1, 11). Option 1 (zero vs one indexing) causes related errors but isn't the range-specific issue. Option 2 (manual increment) shows misunderstanding—for loops handle variable update automatically; manual increment is irrelevant. Option 3 (>= vs >) applies to while loops, not for with range. The range behavior is consistent throughout Python (also in slicing: list[0:5] gives items 0-4). When asking AI: 'print numbers 1 to 10 inclusive' makes intent clear; AI will correctly use range(1, 11). Testing loop boundaries (first, last, one-beyond) catches off-by-one errors early. This pattern appears in any range-based iteration.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Repetition with Loops"
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you choose while True with break inside instead of a for loop with known iteration count?",
      options: [
        "When better performance is required for large iteration counts",
        "When the loop needs to run exactly once before checking condition",
        "When exit condition depends on runtime input or state changes",
        "When the loop variable needs to be accessible outside the block"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is when exit depends on runtime input or state. While True with break is the 'loop indefinitely until something happens' pattern. You don't know in advance when to stop—the stop condition emerges during execution (user enters 'quit', valid input received, connection successful). Option 1 (run once before check) describes do-while semantics, which Python doesn't have directly—not why you'd use while True. Option 2 (performance) is wrong—loop type doesn't significantly affect speed. Option 3 (variable scope) is incorrect—loop variables are accessible outside both for and while loops in Python. Use case example: retry logic with exponential backoff—you don't know how many attempts succeed will take. When describing to AI: 'keep trying until success' or 'repeat until user quits' signals while True with break pattern. This expresses intent more clearly than inventing a maximum iteration count.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Repetition with Loops"
    },
    {
      question: "You're reviewing AI-generated code with nested for loops over range(1000). What's your primary concern?",
      options: [
        "The loops should use while instead of for for better readability",
        "The nested loop variables might accidentally use same name causing conflicts",
        "The range function will consume too much memory for this size",
        "The code runs 1,000,000 iterations which may impact performance significantly"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is 1,000,000 iterations may impact performance. Nested loops multiply iteration counts: 1000 × 1000 = 1 million operations. If each iteration does expensive work (API call, database query, complex calculation), this could take minutes or hours. Option 1 (variable name collision) is a code quality issue but doesn't affect correctness if names are unique. Option 2 (range memory) is incorrect—range is memory-efficient in Python 3 (generates values lazily). Option 3 (while vs for) reverses best practice—for is clearer for known counts. When reviewing such code, ask: 'Do I really need every combination?' Often filtering before looping or using different algorithms reduces work. When asking AI to generate nested loops, specify: 'check if filtering reduces iteration count before nesting.' Understanding computational complexity prevents performance problems.",

    },
    {
      question: "When would using enumerate() in a for loop improve code quality compared to range(len(list))?",
      options: [
        "When you need both the item value and its index position",
        "When the list might be modified during iteration requiring index tracking",
        "When performance optimization is critical for large lists over 10000 items",
        "When the loop needs to support both forward and reverse iteration modes"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is when you need both item value and index. Enumerate provides (index, value) pairs directly: for i, item in enumerate(items). This is more Pythonic than for i in range(len(items)) with items[i]. Option 1 (modifying during iteration) is dangerous with any method—enumerate doesn't make this safe. Option 2 (performance) is negligible—both approaches have similar speed. Option 3 (forward/reverse) misunderstands enumerate—direction is controlled by reversed() or list slicing, not enumerate itself. The readability advantage matters: enumerate makes intent clear ('I need position and value'), while range(len()) suggests C-style thinking. When asking AI for iteration with index, say: 'iterate with both index and value' triggers enumerate usage. Understanding Pythonic patterns like this improves code quality and maintenance.",

      question: "In a search loop, you find the target item at index 3 in a 1000-item list. What's break's advantage over continuing to check remaining items?",
      options: [
        "Break prevents the loop from modifying the list during iteration",
        "Break exits immediately saving 997 unnecessary iterations and improving efficiency",
        "Break allows the loop-else clause to detect successful search completion",
        "Break ensures the loop variable retains the found index value outside"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is break saves 997 unnecessary iterations. Once you find what you're searching for, checking the remaining 997 items wastes time. Break implements early exit optimization—stop when the task is complete. Option 1 (prevents modification) is wrong—break doesn't affect list modification safety. Option 2 (loop-else) reverses the truth—break prevents else from running; it's for detecting 'not found.' Option 3 (variable retention) is irrelevant—loop variables persist after loop exit with or without break. The performance gain is significant for large datasets: O(n) worst case becomes O(k) average case where k is position found. When describing search logic to AI: 'exit immediately when found' clearly signals break usage. Understanding early exit optimization is fundamental to efficient algorithms.",

        "Break exits the entire loop while continue skips current iteration only"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is break exits entirely while continue skips current iteration. Break says 'I'm done with this loop completely,' moving execution to after the loop. Continue says 'I'm done with this iteration,' jumping to the next iteration. Option 1 (for vs while) is wrong—both work in both loop types. Option 2 (if requirement) is incorrect—neither requires if, though both are commonly used inside conditionals. Option 3 (nesting behavior) misunderstands both—in nested loops, both affect only the innermost loop they're in. Example: filtering a list with continue processes all items, skipping invalid ones; finding an item with break stops at first match. When asking AI: 'skip negative numbers' triggers continue; 'stop when found' triggers break. Understanding this distinction prevents logic errors where you exit when you meant to skip, or skip when you meant to exit.",

        "The else clause handles exceptions raised during validation inside the loop"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is else runs when loop completes without break. In retry logic: break on success (valid input), else on failure (exhausted attempts). The pattern: while attempts &lt; 3: if valid: break; attempts += 1 else: print('Failed'). Option 1 (after each iteration) misunderstands—else runs once after loop ends, not during. Option 2 (default value) is wrong—else doesn't provide values. Option 3 (exception handling) confuses control flow with error handling—you'll learn exceptions in Chapter 25. Without while...else, you'd need a flag variable: success = False; while...: if valid: success = True; break. The else clause eliminates this boilerplate. When asking AI for retry logic, say: 'try up to 3 times, detect if any succeeded' naturally maps to while...else. This pattern is uncommon but powerful for failure detection.",

        "The break statement exits the loop but still executes else clause"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is else runs only without break. If break executes, else is skipped. The code has a logic error: 'Not found' should be inside the else block. Current structure: for...if break else: print('All valid'); print('Not found') outside loop runs regardless. Option 1 (indentation of 'Not found') is correct—but that's the fix, not the explanation of why behavior occurs. Option 2 (else with if) misreads structure—else is properly aligned with for. Option 3 (break still runs else) reverses the truth—break explicitly prevents else. The pattern: for...else is for search with failure case. Correct: for item in items: if match: found = True; break else: print('Not found'). When asking AI for search logic, specify: 'print not found only if loop completes without finding' ensures correct structure. Misplaced statements outside loop blocks cause logic bugs.",

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is break for termination, continue for filtering. Pattern: iterate through all items, skip some (continue), stop if critical condition met (break). Example: sum positive numbers up to first zero—continue for negative (skip), break for zero (stop). Option 1 (counter control) misunderstands—neither directly affects loop counters; for loops manage counters automatically. Option 2 (outer vs inner) is wrong—both affect only the loop they're in. Option 3 (error vs normal) confuses control flow with exception handling—neither is specifically for errors. Use case: process records until terminator, skipping invalid ones: for record in records: if invalid: continue (skip); if terminator: break (stop); process(record). When asking AI: 'skip invalid items but stop completely when....' signals combined usage. Understanding this pattern handles complex iteration logic cleanly.",

      question: "You're building eligibility logic: age 18-65, if under 25 need recommendation, if over 60 need health clearance. What structure handles this efficiently?",
      options: [
        "Match-case with age as expression and range patterns as cases",

      explanation: "The correct answer is nested if checking ranges then sub-ranges. Structure: if 18 &lt;= age &lt;= 65: if age &lt; 25: check recommendation; elif age > 60: check health; else: approve. This creates a decision tree: first validate range, then check subrange requirements. Option 1 (three separate ifs) breaks the logic hierarchy—requirements depend on age range.

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is inner loop completes for each outer iteration. Think of reading a book: for each page (outer loop), read every line on that page (inner loop) before turning the page. For row in range(3): for col in range(3): print(row, col) outputs (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), then (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), then (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Option 1 (indentation priority) invents nonexistent behavior—Python doesn't prioritize by indentation beyond defining block structure. Option 2 (range caching) misunderstands—range behavior doesn't affect execution order. Option 3 (synchronization) is wrong—loops are independent; no automatic coordination exists. The nested loop pattern creates two-dimensional iteration: outer controls rows, inner controls columns within each row. Total iterations: outer_count × inner_count.

Option 1 (interpreter limit) is wrong—Python has no hard nesting limit (you'd hit practical limits like stack size first). Option 2 (memory exponential) is incorrect—memory usage depends on data structures, not nesting depth. Option 3 (variable accessibility) is false—inner blocks can access outer variables. Red flag: if you have 4+ indentation levels, consider flattening: combine conditions with and/or, use early continue/break to reduce nesting, or extract inner logic to functions (Chapter 24).

After break, i loop continues with next iteration. Option 1 (all loops) is wrong—break doesn't cascade outward. Option 2 (outermost first) reverses behavior. Option 3 (labeled break) refers to other languages (Java)—Python doesn't have loop labels. To exit both loops, use a flag: found = False; for i: for j: if condition: found = True; break; if found: break. Or better: move logic to a function and use return (Chapter 24).

Loops inside conditionals control whether iteration happens at all: if valid: for item in items: process(item). Option 1 (depends on iteration values) is true but too narrow—it describes one use case of a broader pattern. Option 2 (skip entirely) describes loops inside conditionals, not the reverse.

        "Break actually slows down the loop due to exit overhead",
        "Break provides minimal benefit because modern Python optimizes loops automatically",
        "Break saves 997 iterations reducing runtime from O(n) to O(k)",
        "Break has no performance impact but improves code readability"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is break saves 997 iterations, improving from O(n) to O(k) where k is find position. Without break: 1000 iterations even after finding the target. With break: 3 iterations. For large datasets, this is dramatic: searching 1M items finding at position 100 is 100 iterations with break vs 1M without. Option 1 (Python optimizes) is wrong—Python can't know your search succeeded without break. Option 2 (break slows down) is false—exit overhead is negligible vs iteration cost. Option 3 (readability only) underestimates performance gain. When asking AI for search logic: 'find first occurrence and stop' signals break usage. This is the 'early exit' optimization pattern—fundamental to efficient algorithms. Understanding this guides when to use break for correctness (stop when found) and performance (avoid wasted work).",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is continue is clearer than nested ifs. Compare: for item in items: if invalid: continue; process(item) versus for item in items: if valid: process(item). The continue version reads: 'skip bad items, process rest.' The if version nests processing inside conditional. Option 1 (performance) is negligible—both are fast. Option 2 (multiple items) misunderstands—continue skips current iteration only. Option 3 (logging) is wrong—continue doesn't automatically log anything. Benefit: continue avoids deep nesting when multiple skip conditions exist: for item: if condition1: continue; if condition2: continue; process(item). With nested ifs: for item: if not condition1: if not condition2: process(item) (harder to read). When asking AI: 'skip negative numbers' signals continue usage.

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is only when loop completes without break. If break executes, else is skipped. If loop completes normally (all iterations finished or sequence empty), else runs. Option 1 (always finishes) is wrong—break specifically prevents else. Option 2 (exception) confuses control flow with exception handling—exceptions don't trigger else. Option 3 (empty sequence) is counterintuitive but correct—iterating zero items is completing without break, so else runs. Pattern: for...else is for 'search with not-found case': for item in items: if match: found = item; break else: print('not found'). When asking AI: 'search list and print message if not found' signals for...else usage. Understanding when else runs prevents logic bugs where you expect it to skip on empty list but it doesn't.",

      explanation: "The correct answer is all of the above. Issue 1: else implies 'if condition failed,' but loop-else means 'if break didn't happen'—opposite intuition from if-else. Issue 2: empty sequences (zero iterations) still trigger else because 'completed without break' technically happened. Issue 3: Java, C, JavaScript lack loop-else—developers expect if-else semantics. Better name would be 'nobreak,' but Python uses 'else' for consistency. When to use: search patterns where you need to know 'did I find it or check everything?'

If success happens (break), else is skipped. If all 3 attempts fail (loop completes), else runs. Option 1 (after each attempt) is wrong—else runs once at loop end, not per iteration. Option 2 (reset counter) misunderstands—else doesn't modify state. Option 3 (exceptions) confuses control flow with error handling. Without while...else, you'd use a flag: success = False; while...: if valid: success = True; break; if not success: print('failed'). While...else eliminates the flag.

      explanation: "The correct answer is continue skips negatives, break stops at zero, positives process. Pattern: for num in nums: if num &lt; 0: continue (skip); if num == 0: break (stop); total += num (process positive). Three outcomes per item: skip (continue), stop (break), or process. Option 1 (error vs normal) misframes—neither is specifically for errors. Option 2 (reset/finalize) invents nonexistent semantics—neither affects accumulators automatically. Option 3 (inner vs outer) confuses nesting behavior—both affect only the loop they're in. This demonstrates selective processing with early termination: iterate, filter (continue), terminate (break), process (no keyword).

Outer loop index 0: inner loop runs 10 times (0-9). Outer index 1: inner runs 10 times again. Pattern continues through outer index 9. Option 1 (caching) is wrong—Python doesn't optimize this way.

      explanation: "The correct answer is 3-4+ indentation levels signals complexity. Deep nesting makes code hard to understand: which context am I in? What conditions are active? Reading deeply nested code requires mental stack management. Option 1 (variable naming) is unrelated to complexity. Option 2 (iteration count) conflates complexity with performance—10k iterations might be necessary and clear. Option 3 (3+ ifs anywhere) is absurd—if statements don't indicate complexity by count alone.
