  questions={[    {
      question: "Why does Python need a type system to classify different kinds of data?",
      options: [
        "Types make programs run faster by optimizing memory usage",
        "Types determine what operations are valid for each value",
        "Types prevent programmers from making any coding mistakes",
        "Types automatically fix errors when programs detect bad inputs"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that types determine what operations are valid for each value. Python needs to know whether you're working with numbers (which can be added), text (which can be joined), or True/False values (used in decisions) to know which operations make sense. While types do affect memory (option 2), that's not their primary purpose. Types don't prevent all mistakes (option 3) or automatically fix errors (option 4)—they provide guardrails that help Python understand your intent and catch type mismatches early.",

    },
    {
      question: "You're building a user profile that stores age, email address, and whether the user is a premium member. Which types should you use?",
      options: [
        "age: float, email: str, is_premium: int using zero or one",
        "age: int, email: list, is_premium: None for optional status",
        "age: str, email: str, is_premium: str using text values",
        "age: int, email: str, is_premium: bool for True or False"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is age: int, email: str, is_premium: bool. Age should be int because people are whole numbers of years old (25, not 25.5). Email is str because it's text. Premium membership is a yes/no decision, making bool the perfect choice. Option 1 uses float for age (wrong—ages are whole numbers) and int for yes/no (wrong—use bool for clarity). Option 3 stores everything as strings, losing the ability to do math with age or use logical operations with premium status. Option 4 uses list for email (wrong type) and None for a boolean decision (None means 'no value', not True/False).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Understanding Data Types"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the type() function actually return when you call type(42)?",
      options: [
        "A type object representing the class of the value",
        "The string text containing the name of the type",
        "A boolean indicating whether the value is a valid type",
        "An integer code representing the type in Python's internal system"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that type() returns a type object representing the class of the value. When you run type(42), you get <class 'int'>, which is a type object—Python's internal representation of the int class. It's not a string like \"int\" (option 2), though it displays similarly when printed. It doesn't return a boolean (option 3)—every value has a type, so there's no 'invalid type' check. It's not an integer code (option 4)—Python uses actual objects to represent types, not numeric codes. This matters when comparing types: type(x) == int compares type objects, not strings.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Understanding Data Types"
    },
    {
      question: "You're processing API responses where some fields might be missing. For an optional phone number, which type declaration is correct?",
      options: [
        "phone: str with empty string when missing value",
        "phone: bool to show whether number was provided",
        "phone: str | None to indicate optional text value",
        "phone: list with zero items when not provided"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is phone: str | None to indicate optional text value. This type hint (read as 'string or None') explicitly communicates that the phone field could contain text OR be absent (None). Option 1 (empty string) confuses 'no phone provided' with 'phone is empty string'—semantically different. If someone provides an empty string, that's still a string value; None means no value was provided at all. Option 3 (bool) only tells you yes/no but doesn't store the actual phone number. Option 4 (list) is the wrong structure for a single text field. The str | None pattern is the Pythonic way to represent optional data.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Text, Boolean, and None"
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you use int for storing product inventory count instead of float?",
      options: [
        "Integers take up less memory space than floating-point numbers",
        "You cannot have fractional products like half an item",
        "Integers are faster to process than decimal floating-point values",
        "Floats can only store numbers up to a limit"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that you cannot have fractional products like half an item. Inventory represents discrete, countable units—you either have 25 items or 26 items, never 25.7 items. Using int expresses this constraint semantically: 'this value must be whole.' While int can use less memory than float (option 1), that's not the primary reason—semantic correctness matters more. Speed differences (option 3) are negligible for most applications. Option 4 is backwards: floats have size limits, but Python ints have unlimited range. The key insight: choose types based on what the data represents, not performance optimization.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Numeric Types"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you run this code: result = 5 / 2?",
      options: [
        "result becomes integer two because both values are integers",
        "Python raises error because integers cannot be divided",
        "result becomes string because division cannot mix different types",
        "result becomes float two point five from division operator"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that result becomes float 2.5 from the division operator. In Python 3, the / operator ALWAYS returns a float, even when dividing two integers. This prevents data loss from truncation. Option 1 is wrong—that behavior existed in Python 2, but Python 3 changed it. If you want integer division (discarding the remainder), use // instead: 5 // 2 gives 2. Option 3 is wrong—numbers can definitely be divided. Option 4 is wrong—division works fine. This is a common beginner mistake: expecting int / int to stay int. Python's design choice prioritizes correctness (preserving the fractional part) over surprising type preservation.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Numeric Types"
    },
    {
      question: "You're asked to store RGB color values for a design system. Which type is most appropriate and why?",
      options: [
        "Tuple of three integers because color values are fixed",
        "List of three integers because colors change during runtime",
        "Dictionary mapping names to integers for each color component",
        "Set of three integers to ensure unique values"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is tuple of three integers because color values are fixed. Once you define a color like (255, 0, 128), those RGB values shouldn't change—the color IS that specific combination. Tuple's immutability protects against accidental modification. Option 1 (list) allows changes, which risks breaking color definitions: if someone modifies colors[0], you've lost the original color. Option 3 (dict) is overkill—you need ordered triplets, not key-value pairs. Option 4 (set) loses order and removes duplicates, so (0, 0, 255) might become {0, 255}, which is wrong. Tuples communicate intent: this is a fixed, ordered structure.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Collections and Binary Types"
    },
    {
      question: "When reviewing AI-generated code, you see age: int = 25.5. What's the issue?",
      options: [
        "Variable names cannot contain three letter combinations like age",
        "Python will automatically round the value to twenty-six",
        "Type hint says int but value is float causing mismatch",
        "Assignment operator equals sign is used incorrectly here"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that the type hint says int but the value is float, causing a mismatch. The type hint age: int promises 'this will be an integer,' but 25.5 is a float. Python won't enforce this at runtime (it allows the assignment), but type checkers like mypy will flag it as an error. Option 2 is wrong—Python won't automatically round; the value stays 25.5 (as a float), violating the type hint. Option 3 is nonsense—age is a perfectly valid variable name. Option 4 is wrong—the equals sign is correct. The real lesson: type hints are promises to readers (human and AI) about what type a variable should hold. Breaking that promise confuses everyone and tools.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Numeric Types"
    },
    {
      question: "Which values are falsy in Python, meaning they evaluate to False in boolean contexts?",
      options: [
        "False, string containing zero, integer minus one values",
        "False, negative numbers, whitespace strings, and zero lists",
        "Only the boolean False and None type values",
        "False, zero, empty string, empty list, and None"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is False, 0, empty string (''), empty list ([]), and None. These are Python's core falsy values. Also falsy: empty dict ({}), empty tuple (()), empty set (set()), and 0.0. Option 2 is wrong: negative numbers are truthy (non-zero), whitespace strings like ' ' are truthy (non-empty). Option 3 is incomplete—many values besides False and None are falsy. Option 4 is wrong: the string '0' is truthy (it's a non-empty string), and -1 is truthy (non-zero). The pattern: empty containers, zero numbers, False, and None are falsy. Everything else is truthy. This matters when you write conditions like 'if username:' to check for non-empty input.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Text, Boolean, and None"
    },
    {
      question: "Why is None different from an empty string '' or zero 0?",
      options: [
        "None is faster to process than empty or zero values",
        "None represents absence of value, while empty and zero exist",
        "None can be used in math operations unlike strings",
        "None takes less memory than empty strings or zero"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that None represents absence of value, while empty string and zero are actual values that exist. Think semantically: 0 means 'the count is zero' (a count exists), '' means 'the message is empty' (text exists, just has no characters), but None means 'no value at all'—nothing was provided. For optional user input like middle name, use None to mean 'not provided' rather than '' which could mean 'provided but empty.' Option 2 is wrong—performance isn't the point. Option 3 is wrong—None can't be used in math either. Option 4 is wrong—memory differences are negligible. The key insight: None is Python's way to represent 'missing' or 'not applicable,' which is semantically different from 'zero' or 'empty.'",
      source: "Lesson 3: Text, Boolean, and None"
    },
    {
      question: "You need to store unique product IDs where duplicates should be automatically removed. Which collection type is best?",
      options: [
        "Set because it automatically enforces uniqueness of items",
        "List because it maintains insertion order for IDs",
        "Dictionary mapping IDs to boolean True for presence",
        "Tuple because IDs should not change once defined"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is set because it automatically enforces uniqueness. If you add duplicate IDs to a set, Python silently removes them: {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} becomes {1, 2, 3}. This matches your requirement perfectly. Option 1 (list) allows duplicates, forcing you to manually check and remove them—more error-prone. Option 3 (dict with True values) works but is unnecessarily complex: {'id1': True, 'id2': True}—you don't need values, just unique keys. Option 4 (tuple) is immutable, preventing you from adding new IDs as they arrive. Sets are designed for 'collection of unique items'—use the right tool for the job.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Collections and Binary Types"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the key difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
      options: [
        "Lists are ordered while tuples are unordered collections",
        "Lists can hold multiple types but tuples hold one type",
        "Lists are mutable but tuples are immutable after creation",
        "Lists are faster for lookups but tuples for insertions"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that lists are mutable (changeable) but tuples are immutable (fixed). You can add, remove, or modify items in a list after creation, but tuples are sealed once created. Option 1 is wrong—both lists and tuples maintain order. Option 3 is wrong—both can hold multiple types (though it's usually better to keep types consistent). Option 4 is backwards—neither is specifically optimized for insertions vs. lookups that way. The immutability of tuples makes them perfect for data that shouldn't change, like RGB color values (255, 0, 128) or coordinates (40.7, -74.0). Lists are for collections that grow, shrink, or change.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Collections and Binary Types"
    },
    {
      question: "You're prompting AI to generate code that stores student grades by name. Which collection type should you describe?",
      options: [
        "List of grades for fast sequential access to data",
        "Tuple of grade values to prevent accidental changes",
        "Set to ensure each student appears only once",
        "Dictionary mapping student names to their grade values"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is dictionary mapping student names to their grade values. You need to look up grades by student name, which is exactly what dictionaries do: {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 87}. You ask 'What is Bob's grade?' and get 87 instantly. Option 1 (list) forces you to remember positions: grades[0] is Alice, grades[1] is Bob—fragile and unclear. Option 3 (set) can't store grades at all, only unique names. Option 4 (tuple) doesn't solve the lookup problem and prevents updates if a grade changes. When prompting AI, describe access patterns: 'I need to look up grades by student name' naturally leads AI to suggest dict[str, int].",
      source: "Lesson 4: Collections and Binary Types"
    },
    {
      question: "What does isinstance(value, (int, float)) check for in your code?",
      options: [
        "Checks if value can be converted to numeric format",
        "Checks if value is integer or floating-point number type",
        "Checks if value is tuple containing integers or floats",
        "Checks if value matches exactly the integer type class"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that it checks if value is either int or float type. The syntax isinstance(value, (int, float)) with a tuple of types means 'is value an instance of any of these types?' If value is 42 (int) or 3.14 (float), it returns True. If value is 'hello' (str), it returns False. Option 2 is wrong—isinstance() checks current type, not convertibility. Option 3 misreads the syntax—it's not checking if value IS a tuple. Option 4 is wrong—isinstance() is more flexible than exact matching; it accepts subclasses. This pattern is useful when you need 'any numeric type': if isinstance(x, (int, float)) checks if you can do math with x.",
      source: "Lesson 5: Type Utilities and Capstone"
    },
    {
      question: "Why is it better to write phone: str | None instead of using empty string '' for missing phones?",
      options: [
        "None takes less memory than storing empty string values",
        "Empty strings cause errors when used in conditional statements",
        "None distinguishes missing data from actual empty string input",
        "Type checkers reject empty strings for optional text fields"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that None distinguishes missing data from actual empty string input. Semantically, '' means 'user provided an empty string' while None means 'no data provided at all.' If your form allows users to submit blank phone fields, '' is a valid input. But if the phone field wasn't submitted (optional), use None. Option 1 is wrong—memory differences are negligible. Option 3 is wrong—empty strings work fine in conditions (they're just falsy). Option 4 is wrong—type checkers handle '' for str fields. The real value: None communicates intent to humans and AI. When you see phone: str | None = None, you know 'this field is optional,' not 'default is empty.'",
      source: "Lesson 3: Text, Boolean, and None"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you try to convert the string 'hello' to an integer using int('hello')?",
      options: [
        "Python raises ValueError because conversion is not possible here",
        "Python converts each letter to ASCII number code values",
        "Python returns zero as default for invalid string conversions",
        "Python returns None to indicate conversion could not happen"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that Python raises a ValueError because the conversion isn't possible. int() expects strings that look like numbers: int('42') works, int('3.14') works, but int('hello') fails—there's no way to interpret 'hello' as an integer. Option 1 is wrong—int() doesn't do ASCII conversion (use ord() for that). Option 3 is wrong—Python doesn't silently return 0; it raises an exception to force you to handle the error. Option 4 is wrong—Python doesn't return None; it stops execution with an error. This is defensive design: instead of giving you garbage data, Python alerts you to the problem immediately so you can fix it.",
      source: "Lesson 5: Type Utilities and Capstone"
    },
    {
      question: "You're building a shopping cart. Items can be added or removed, and you need to access items by position. Which collection fits best?",
      options: [
        "Tuple because cart items should not change order",
        "List for ordered mutable collection of cart items",
        "Dictionary mapping item positions to product information for lookup",
        "Set to ensure duplicate products cannot be added"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is list for ordered mutable collection. Shopping carts change frequently (add/remove items), items have a natural order (first added to last), and you need positional access ('remove item 2'). List handles all of this perfectly. Option 2 (tuple) is wrong—tuples are immutable, so you can't add/remove items without creating a new tuple each time (inefficient). Option 3 (dict) is overkill—you don't need key-value mapping for simple ordered storage. Option 4 (set) loses order and prevents having 2 of the same product, which breaks shopping carts. The type choice communicates your needs: list[Product] tells AI 'ordered, changeable collection,' enabling appropriate method suggestions like append(), pop(), insert().",
      source: "Lesson 4: Collections and Binary Types"
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't you modify individual characters in a Python string after creation?",
      options: [
        "Character modification requires converting strings to byte arrays",
        "Python stores strings in read-only sections of memory",
        "Modifying strings would break all string comparison operations",
        "Strings are immutable by design for data integrity"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that strings are immutable by design for data integrity and safety. Once you create 'hello', that string object never changes. If you want 'jello', you create a NEW string. This prevents accidental modifications and makes strings predictable—your AI collaborator knows strings won't be modified unexpectedly. Option 2 oversimplifies—the technical implementation is more complex than just 'read-only memory.' Option 3 is wrong—comparisons would work fine with mutable strings. Option 4 is wrong—you can't modify characters even with byte arrays; immutability is fundamental. Immutability enables optimizations like string interning and makes concurrent programming safer. It's a deliberate design choice, not a limitation.",

        "Write user data storage with proper Python type annotations"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is 'Define user profile with types: name is text, age is whole number, email is text, premium is yes/no.' This prompt describes INTENT and DATA CHARACTERISTICS, not implementation syntax. It tells AI what the data represents and its semantic properties. Option 1 is too vague—no type guidance. Option 3 jumps to classes (premature—you might just need variables). Option 4 uses jargon without describing the actual data. The best AI prompts answer: WHAT data do you have? WHAT properties does it have? From 'text,' AI suggests str. From 'whole number,' AI suggests int. From 'yes/no,' AI suggests bool. Describe the problem domain, not the syntax.",

        "Type hints improve program execution speed through compiler optimization work"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that type hints communicate intent to humans and analysis tools. When you write age: int = 25, you're documenting 'this variable should hold integers.' Python doesn't enforce this at runtime (option 1 is wrong)—you can assign age = 'hello' and Python allows it. Type hints don't convert values automatically (option 2 is wrong). They don't affect runtime speed (option 4 is wrong). Their power lies in communication: other developers (and AI tools like Claude Code) understand your intent. Tools like mypy can check for type violations before you run code. In AI-native development, clear type hints help your AI collaborator suggest appropriate operations and catch mistakes early.",

      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is to check using if data is not None: for presence. This distinguishes between 'no data provided' (None) and 'empty data provided' (''). If data is None, the field wasn't submitted. If data == '', the user submitted an empty string—still valid input. Option 2 only checks for empty strings, missing the None case. Option 3 is overly complex and treats '' as falsy, which might not be what you want. Option 4 only checks type, not whether data exists. The pattern field: str | None with if field is not None: clearly expresses 'optional field that might be missing' and checks for presence correctly.",

        "Dictionaries maintain sorted order of user account data"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that dictionaries allow looking up values by descriptive names. With dict, you write user['email'] instead of user[1], making code self-documenting. You don't need to remember 'position 0 is name, position 1 is email'—the keys tell you. Option 1 is wrong—memory differences are negligible. Option 3 is wrong—dicts don't prevent duplicate entries (you can overwrite values). Option 4 is wrong—dicts maintain insertion order (as of Python 3.7+), but they're not sorted. The semantic power: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25} is instantly readable. [('Alice', 25)] requires mental mapping. Dictionaries communicate structure through keys.",

      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that id() returns the unique memory address where the object is stored. Every object in Python has an identity—a unique location in memory. You can use id() to check if two variables point to the exact same object: id(x) == id(y) means they're the same object, not just equal values. Option 2 is wrong—id() doesn't return a type code (use type() for that). Option 3 is wrong—id() doesn't convert values to integers. Option 4 is wrong—id() doesn't measure size (use sys.getsizeof() for that). id() is mainly useful for understanding object identity, the 'is' operator, and Python's optimization strategies like integer caching and None singleton.",

Option 1 is wrong—use round() if you want rounding: round(19.99) gives 20. Option 3 is wrong—the decimal doesn't get stored separately; it's gone.

Every variable set to None points to the same object. Therefore, x is None (identity check) is the Pythonic way, not x == None (equality check). Option 2 is wrong—there aren't multiple None instances. Option 3 is wrong—None is always NoneType. Option 4 is wrong—while None is falsy, using bool() isn't idiomatic for None checks. The pattern: if value is None: (idiomatic) vs. if value == None: (works but not Pythonic). When reviewing AI code, suggest is None over == None for style.",

      question: "You need to generate a sequence of 1000 numbers for testing. Why is range(1000) better than creating a 1000-item list?",
      options: [
        "Range automatically sorts numbers unlike lists requiring manual sorting",
        "Range provides built-in validation ensuring numbers are sequential",
        "Range generates numbers lazily saving memory for large sequences",
        "Range prevents accidental modification of number sequence during iteration"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that range generates numbers lazily, saving memory. range(1000) doesn't create 1000 integers in memory—it calculates them as needed during iteration. For range(1000000), the memory savings are enormous. Option 2 is weak—ranges always produce sequential numbers by definition, but that's not the primary advantage. Option 3 is wrong—lists don't need sorting if you create them in order. Option 4 is true (ranges are immutable) but not the main reason. The lesson: use range for iteration and number sequences, especially large ones. When prompting AI, 'generate numbers 0 to 999' leads AI to suggest range(1000), not list(range(1000)).",

      question: "How do type hints improve AI-generated code quality when you request modifications?",
      options: [
        "Type hints force AI to generate only syntactically correct code",
        "Type hints help AI understand context and suggest type-safe changes",
        "Type hints automatically test AI code before showing it to user",
        "Type hints make AI generate code faster with fewer tokens"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that type hints help AI understand context and suggest type-safe changes. When you ask AI to 'add a new field to user profile,' and AI sees user: dict[str, str], it knows to maintain that structure. Without type hints, AI might mix types inconsistently. Option 2 is wrong—type hints don't enforce syntax (syntax is about grammar). Option 3 is wrong—AI doesn't run tests automatically. Option 4 is wrong—type hints might use more tokens (longer code), not fewer. Type hints are specifications that guide AI's reasoning. When requesting modifications, existing type hints tell AI what patterns to follow, reducing errors and back-and-forth clarifications.",
