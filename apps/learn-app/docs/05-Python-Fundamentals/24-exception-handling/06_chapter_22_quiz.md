  questions={[    {
      question: "You're building a user registration function. The user enters 'twenty-five' for age. Which exception type will `int('twenty-five')` raise?",
      options: [
        "ValueError because the string isn't a valid integer",
        "TypeError because int() expects numbers not text",
        "AttributeError because strings lack numeric conversion method",
        "ZeroDivisionError because the conversion fails mathematically"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is ValueError. The int() function accepts strings as input (so no TypeError), but raises ValueError when the string doesn't represent a valid integer. TypeError occurs when you use wrong types for operations (like 5 + 'text'), not for failed conversions. AttributeError happens when accessing missing attributes. ZeroDivisionError is specific to division by zero, unrelated to type conversion.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Exception Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "When reading a Python traceback after a crash, which strategy helps you identify where the error actually occurred?",
      options: [
        "Read top-to-bottom to follow the execution path chronologically",
        "Read bottom-to-top starting with exception type and location",
        "Search for the first line containing your filename",
        "Look for the longest line since detailed errors matter"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is reading bottom-to-top. Python tracebacks show the exception type and message on the last line, which tells you what went wrong. The second-to-last line shows where the error occurred. Working upward shows the call chain. Reading top-to-bottom is less efficient because you don't know what you're looking for. While finding your filename helps, the exception message (at bottom) is the starting point. Line length doesn't indicate error importance.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Exception Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "You're processing API responses that might have missing required fields. Which exception type best represents this validation failure?",
      options: [
        "AttributeError because response objects lack required attributes",
        "IndexError because required fields aren't at expected positions",
        "KeyError because dictionary keys are missing from response",
        "RuntimeError because the error happens during program execution"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is KeyError. When accessing dictionary keys that don't exist (response['missing_field']), Python raises KeyError. This is the standard exception for missing dictionary keys. IndexError applies to list/tuple indices, not dictionary keys. AttributeError is for missing object attributes (obj.missing_attr), not dictionary keys. RuntimeError is a generic exception type that doesn't communicate the specific problem (missing key).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Exception Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "Your function catches ValueError from int() conversion. What information should you include in the error message to help debugging?",
      options: [
        "Only the exception type since developers know what ValueError means",
        "A generic message saying conversion failed without specifics",
        "Python version number and system information for context",
        "The actual input value that caused conversion to fail"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is including the actual input value. Error messages should answer 'what failed and why' by showing context. Knowing the input was 'twenty-five' instead of '25' immediately reveals the problem. Just stating 'ValueError' doesn't help locate the issue. Python version is irrelevant for logic errors like this. Generic messages ('conversion failed') don't provide actionable debugging information. Good error messages include: what operation failed, what input caused it, and ideally what was expected.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Exception Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "You're writing a calculator function. What's the key difference between catching ZeroDivisionError versus preventing division by zero with an if statement?",
      options: [
        "Conditionals prevent errors; exceptions handle errors after occurring",
        "Exception handling executes faster than conditional checks always",
        "Exceptions work for all errors; conditionals work selectively",
        "Both approaches are identical in functionality and performance"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that conditionals prevent errors while exceptions handle them. Using `if denominator != 0:` checks before the operation, avoiding the exception entirely (LBYL: Look Before You Leap). Using try/except performs the operation and handles failure if it occurs (EAFP: Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission). Python prefers EAFP because exceptions aren't slow for the success case. Exceptions aren't faster than conditionals. Exceptions don't handle all math errors (OverflowError, FloatingPointError exist separately). The approaches differ in philosophy: prevention vs. handling.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Exception Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "When does the else block execute in a try/except/else/finally structure?",
      options: [
        "Always after except block finishes handling the caught exception",
        "Only when try block completes without raising any exceptions",
        "Only when finally block completes its cleanup operations successfully",
        "When try block raises exception but except doesn't catch"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is when try completes without exceptions. The else block represents the 'success path'—code that should only run when no exceptions occurred in try. If an exception is raised and caught, except runs but else is skipped. The finally block always runs regardless of exceptions. If try raises an uncaught exception, else doesn't run (exception propagates after finally). This separation clarifies intent: try contains risky code, except handles errors, else handles success, finally guarantees cleanup.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Except, Else, and Finally"
    },
    {
      question: "You're processing a file. Where should file.close() go to guarantee it runs even if processing raises an exception?",
      options: [
        "In the else block after successful file processing",
        "In the except block to close on errors",
        "In the finally block so cleanup always occurs",
        "In the try block right before processing ends"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is the finally block. Finally executes regardless of whether try succeeds, except catches an error, or an exception propagates uncaught. This guarantees the file closes. Putting close() in else means it won't run if an exception occurs (leaving file open). Putting it in except means it won't run on success. Putting it at the end of try means it won't execute if an exception occurs before that line. The finally block is specifically designed for cleanup operations that must happen no matter what.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Except, Else, and Finally"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if both a try block and finally block contain return statements?",
      options: [
        "Python raises SyntaxError because multiple returns are invalid",
        "Python returns a tuple containing both return values",
        "The try block return executes; finally return is ignored",
        "The finally block return value overrides try block return"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that finally's return overrides try's return. When finally contains a return, it replaces any return value from try or except blocks. This is dangerous because finally is meant for cleanup, not altering control flow. It hides the intended return value and makes debugging difficult. This is valid Python (no SyntaxError), but considered bad practice. Professional code avoids return statements in finally blocks. The correct pattern: return from try/except, use finally only for cleanup without return.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Except, Else, and Finally"
    },
    {
      question: "You're reading a config file with JSON.load(). The file exists but contains invalid JSON. Which two exceptions should you catch in separate except blocks?",
      options: [
        "IOError for file access; ValueError for data issues",
        "FileNotFoundError for missing file; JSONDecodeError for invalid content",
        "PermissionError for access rights; TypeError for wrong formats",
        "OSError for system errors; AttributeError for missing methods"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError. FileNotFoundError handles missing files specifically. JSONDecodeError (a subclass of ValueError) handles malformed JSON content. Catching these separately allows different recovery strategies: missing file might use defaults, corrupted JSON might log error and fail. IOError is outdated (replaced by OSError). PermissionError and TypeError don't match the failure modes. OSError is too broad (includes many unrelated errors). AttributeError isn't raised by json.load(). Specific exceptions enable precise error handling.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Except, Else, and Finally"
    },
    {
      question: "When reviewing code with try/except/else/finally, how do you verify the finally block executes in all scenarios?",
      options: [
        "Test success case, caught exception case, uncaught exception case",
        "Only test the success path since finally always runs",
        "Check that finally contains a return statement to guarantee",
        "Verify finally appears last in the code block structure"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is testing all three scenarios: success (no exception), caught exception, and uncaught exception. While finally is guaranteed to run, testing proves it handles all cases correctly (especially cleanup with different variable states). Testing only success doesn't verify finally runs after exceptions. Return statements in finally are bad practice, not a verification method. Finally's position in code doesn't prove it executes correctly. Comprehensive testing ensures finally's cleanup logic works regardless of whether try succeeds, except catches, or exceptions propagate.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Except, Else, and Finally"
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you create a custom InvalidEmailError exception instead of using built-in ValueError for email validation?",
      options: [
        "Custom exceptions execute faster than built-in exception types",
        "ValueError can't be used for string validation purposes",
        "Built-in exceptions require administrative privileges to raise in code",
        "Custom exceptions communicate domain-specific intent and enable targeted catching"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that custom exceptions communicate domain intent and enable targeted catching. InvalidEmailError tells readers exactly what failed (email validation), while ValueError is generic. Callers can catch InvalidEmailError specifically to handle email issues differently from other ValueError causes. Custom exceptions aren't faster (slightly slower due to extra class). ValueError works fine for validation, but doesn't specify what kind. No exceptions require special privileges. Custom exceptions add semantic meaning, enabling precise error handling strategies based on business logic.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Raising and Custom Exceptions"
    },
    {
      question: "You're designing authentication exceptions. What's the benefit of creating an AuthenticationError base class with subclasses for specific failures?",
      options: [
        "Base classes reduce memory usage by sharing exception code",
        "Python requires base classes for all custom exception hierarchies",
        "Callers can catch all auth errors broadly or specific types",
        "Base classes prevent the same exception from being raised twice"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is enabling flexible catching. With a base AuthenticationError class and subclasses (UserNotFoundError, InvalidPasswordError), callers choose granularity. `except AuthenticationError` catches all authentication failures generically. `except UserNotFoundError` handles missing users specifically (maybe prompt registration). This flexibility adapts to different contexts. Base classes don't reduce memory (each instance allocates separately). Python doesn't require base classes (you can inherit directly from Exception). Base classes don't prevent re-raising. Exception hierarchies enable both broad and specific error handling strategies.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Raising and Custom Exceptions"
    },
    {
      question: "When should a custom exception's __init__ method store context as instance attributes (like username, attempt_count)?",
      options: [
        "When callers need programmatic access to error context for recovery",
        "Never; exception messages should contain all needed information",
        "Only when the exception inherits from multiple base classes",
        "Always; Python requires attributes for all custom exception types"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is when callers need programmatic access. Storing self.username and self.attempt_count lets callers examine context: `except InvalidCredentialsError as e: if e.attempt_count >= 3: lock_account()`. This enables logic-driven recovery beyond just logging messages. Messages alone are for humans, not programmatic decisions. Multiple inheritance doesn't dictate attribute requirements. Python doesn't require attributes (simple custom exceptions just inherit from Exception with no __init__). Attributes enable callers to make decisions based on error context, not just display messages.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Raising and Custom Exceptions"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between `raise ValueError('Bad age')` and `raise ValueError('Bad age') from original_error`?",
      options: [
        "The from clause prevents original_error from appearing in logs",
        "Using from preserves the original exception as __cause__ for debugging",
        "The from syntax is required when raising exceptions inside except",
        "Both are identical; from is deprecated in Python versions"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that from preserves the original exception as __cause__. Exception chaining (`raise ... from e`) links the new exception to the original, showing both in tracebacks. This helps debugging by revealing the root cause alongside business-context errors. Without from, the original exception is lost. From doesn't hide the original (it explicitly preserves it). From isn't required in except blocks (you can raise without it). From is modern Python (3+), not deprecated. Exception chaining communicates 'this business error happened because this technical error occurred first.'",
      source: "Lesson 3: Raising and Custom Exceptions"
    },
    {
      question: "You're validating order data. When should validation functions raise exceptions versus returning True/False?",
      options: [
        "Always return booleans since exceptions are slower than conditionals",
        "Return booleans always; exceptions are only for system errors",
        "Use exceptions for user input; booleans for programmatic validation",
        "Raise exceptions when validation failure is exceptional and needs handling"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is raising exceptions when failures need handling. Pythonic design: functions return validated data or raise exceptions (no ambiguity). Exceptions communicate what went wrong (via error message), while booleans don't explain the failure. Exceptions aren't just for system errors—ValueError is perfect for validation. The user-input distinction doesn't determine the pattern. Exceptions aren't slow for typical use cases. The pattern: `validate_age(age)` returns int or raises ValueError. This is clearer than `is_valid, error_msg = validate_age(age)` because callers must handle failures explicitly.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Raising and Custom Exceptions"
    },
    {
      question: "Your API client encounters a network timeout. Why is retry logic appropriate for this error but not for a 404 Not Found response?",
      options: [
        "Timeout errors indicate server problems; not found indicates client bugs",
        "HTTP libraries only support retrying timeout errors automatically in code",
        "Network timeouts are transient; retrying may succeed; not found permanent",
        "Retry logic only applies to connection errors not response errors"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that timeouts are transient while 404 is permanent. Network timeouts often resolve (congestion clears, connection stabilizes), so retry can succeed. A 404 Not Found means the resource doesn't exist—retry won't change that. This is the transient vs. permanent distinction. HTTP libraries don't automatically retry (you implement it). Timeouts don't always mean server problems (could be network issues). Retry applies to any transient error, whether connection or response (429 rate limit is retriable). Strategy choice depends on error nature: transient → retry, permanent → fail or fallback.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Error Handling Strategies"
    },
    {
      question: "When implementing retry logic with exponential backoff, why increase wait time between attempts instead of retrying immediately?",
      options: [
        "Exponential delays give overwhelmed services time to recover between attempts",
        "Python requires increasing delays for try/except to work correctly",
        "Immediate retries are faster and more likely to succeed",
        "Exponential backoff prevents exceptions from being raised in code"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is giving services time to recover. If a service is overloaded, immediate retries worsen the problem (adding to the load). Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) spaces requests, allowing recovery. This is respectful of shared resources. Python doesn't require delays for exceptions to work. Immediate retries are faster initially but less likely to succeed if the service needs recovery time. Backoff doesn't prevent exceptions (it spaces retry attempts). The pattern balances persistence (keep trying) with courtesy (don't overwhelm struggling services).",
      source: "Lesson 4: Error Handling Strategies"
    },
    {
      question: "You're loading user preferences. The file is missing. What's the difference between retry strategy and fallback strategy for this scenario?",
      options: [
        "Retry attempts reading multiple times; fallback uses defaults immediately",
        "Fallback uses default preferences immediately; retry tries reading repeatedly",
        "Retry logs errors while fallback silently uses defaults without logging",
        "Both strategies are identical when handling missing file errors"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that fallback uses defaults immediately while retry attempts repeatedly. For a missing file (permanent error), retry is inappropriate—file won't appear. Fallback recognizes the file is missing and uses defaults immediately, letting the program continue. Retry makes sense for transient errors (file temporarily locked). Logging is orthogonal to strategy choice (both can log). The strategies differ fundamentally: retry assumes the error is temporary, fallback assumes it's permanent and provides an alternative.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Error Handling Strategies"
    },
    {
      question: "When processing a CSV with 1000 rows, 5 have malformed data. Which strategy lets valid rows succeed while skipping bad ones?",
      options: [
        "Retry logic attempts processing each malformed row multiple times",
        "Fallback strategy replaces malformed rows with default row values",
        "Graceful degradation skips invalid rows and continues processing valid",
        "Fail-fast strategy stops processing immediately on first malformed row"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is graceful degradation. This strategy continues operation when non-critical failures occur (individual row errors don't stop batch processing). Try/except inside the row loop catches per-row exceptions, logs them, and continues. Retry doesn't help malformed data (won't become valid). Fallback could work but may introduce incorrect data. Fail-fast would stop at row 1, losing 995 valid rows. Graceful degradation balances robustness (don't crash) with data integrity (skip invalid, keep valid) and transparency (log what was skipped).",

    },
    {
      question: "What essential information should error logs include to enable effective debugging of production issues?",
      options: [
        "User passwords and API keys to reproduce exact conditions",
        "Only the exception message since other context is visible",
        "Complete system memory dumps and all variable state always",
        "Exception type, timestamp, context data, and operation attempted successfully"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is exception type, timestamp, context, and operation. Good logs answer: What failed (exception type/message)? When (timestamp)? What was being attempted (operation)? What data was involved (relevant variables, not all state)? This balance provides debugging information without bloat. Exception messages alone lack context (when did this happen? what data?). Full memory dumps are excessive and slow. Never log passwords or secrets (security violation). Effective logs are selective: enough context to diagnose, not so much they're unusable or reveal sensitive data.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Error Handling Strategies"
    },
    {
      question: "You catch an exception but need the calling function to know the operation failed. What's the appropriate pattern?",

        "Return None and expect caller to check for failure",
        "Log the exception details then re-raise it for caller",
        "Catch the exception and print an error message only",
        "Store exception in global variable caller can check later"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is log then re-raise. This pattern records the error locally (for debugging), then propagates it to callers (so they can decide how to handle). Re-raising preserves the exception type and traceback. Returning None is ambiguous (None could be valid in some contexts). Printing without re-raising hides failure from callers (they think success occurred). Global variables create coupling and concurrency issues. The pattern: `except SomeError as e: log(e); raise` lets both levels contribute: local logs context, caller decides recovery strategy.",

      question: "Your CSV parser encounters FileNotFoundError. What should the error handling strategy be for this scenario versus ValueError on individual rows?",

        "FileNotFoundError should stop program; ValueError should skip row and continue",
        "Both should skip and continue since processing can proceed",
        "Both should retry with exponential backoff until successful completion",
        "FileNotFoundError should log only; ValueError should raise immediately upward"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is FileNotFoundError stops, ValueError skips row. FileNotFoundError is fatal—can't parse a non-existent file. The program should exit with a helpful message. ValueError on a row is non-fatal—bad data in one row doesn't invalidate the whole file. Skip the row, log the error, continue. Continuing without a file makes no sense. Retrying won't make a missing file appear. Logging without stopping wastes CPU parsing nothing. This demonstrates error classification: fatal errors (file access) stop early; non-fatal errors (data validation) degrade gracefully.",

      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is raise for invalid, return for valid. This is Pythonic: functions either succeed (return result) or fail (raise exception). No ambiguity. Callers use try/except to handle validation failures. Returning tuples (success, data_or_error) is verbose and error-prone (callers might forget to check success). Returning None is ambiguous (None might be valid in some contexts). Raising only for built-in failures misses validation logic errors. The pattern: `age = validate_age(user_input)` either assigns valid age or raises ValueError. Explicit error handling via exceptions.",

        "Outside the file operation to halt processing and report"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is outside file operations. PermissionError is fatal—can't continue reading without permissions. Catch it at the file-opening level, report helpful message, exit gracefully. Catching inside the row loop doesn't make sense (permission applies to the whole file). Validation functions validate data, not file access. Letting it crash shows users raw tracebacks (confusing for non-programmers). The architecture: outer try/except for file operations (fatal), inner try/except for row processing (non-fatal). Each level handles errors at its appropriate scope.",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is mixed valid/invalid data. This tests the core promise: parser handles errors gracefully, processes valid data, skips invalid, and reports accurately. All-valid tests happy path only (doesn't test error handling). Empty file is one edge case (useful, but narrow). Max file size tests performance, not error handling. Mixed data proves graceful degradation: some rows pass validation, others fail, parser continues, summary reflects reality. This simulates production: real data is messy. Robust parsers handle messiness without crashing.",

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is row number, field, value, expectation. Helpful errors answer: Where (row 5)? What field (age)? What was wrong (got 'twenty')? What's valid (0-150)? This lets users fix issues. Tracebacks are for developers, not end users. Exception type alone doesn't help users ('ValueError' doesn't say what to fix). Generic messages frustrate users ('validation failed' doesn't identify the problem). Good messages are actionable, specific, and contextual.",

    {
      question: "You're debugging exception handling. AI generated try/except code that catches Exception instead of specific types. What's the risk?",
      options: [
        "Catching Exception prevents logging from working correctly in code",
        "Exception is too slow; specific types execute faster always",
        "Python raises SyntaxError for overly broad exception catching patterns",
        "Catches too broadly; might hide unexpected bugs that should crash"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
