  questions={[    {
      question: "You need to calculate a circle's area using math.pi. Why should you use math.pi instead of hardcoding 3.14159?",
      options: [
        "math.pi provides greater precision for calculations",
        "math.pi automatically adjusts for screen resolution",
        "math.pi is required syntax in Python",
        "math.pi converts values to scientific notation"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "math.pi provides approximately 15 decimal places of precision (3.141592653589793), while hardcoded 3.14159 only has 5 decimal places. This precision difference compounds in large calculations or scientific computing. Option 2 is incorrect—math.pi has nothing to do with screen resolution. Option 3 is false—you can use any numeric value, but math.pi is more accurate. Option 4 is incorrect—math.pi is simply a float constant, not a formatting function. Always use math.pi for mathematical accuracy in production code.",

    },
    {
      question: "When using math.sqrt(-1), Python 3.14 raises a ValueError with 'math domain error'. What does this error indicate?",
      options: [
        "The math module needs to be updated",
        "The operation is mathematically undefined for real",
        "The input value exceeds memory limits",
        "The function requires a different data type"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "A 'math domain error' indicates you're asking for a mathematically impossible operation in the real number system—negative numbers have no real square roots (only complex/imaginary roots). This is a constraint of mathematics, not Python. Option 2 is incorrect—the error is intentional validation, not a bug. Option 3 is false—domain errors aren't memory-related. Option 4 is incorrect—sqrt accepts floats; the issue is the mathematical constraint (must be ≥0). Always validate inputs before calling math.sqrt() to prevent domain errors.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Math Module Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "You're calculating currency totals where fractional cents under $0.01 should always round up. Which function ensures this behavior?",
      options: [
        "math.floor() always rounds toward zero",
        "round() uses banker's rounding for consistency",
        "math.ceil() always rounds toward positive infinity",
        "abs() converts negative values to positive"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "math.ceil() always rounds UP to the next integer (toward positive infinity), so $2.001 becomes $3.00. This ensures no fractional cents are lost. Option 2 (round) uses banker's rounding (rounds to nearest even), so 2.5 becomes 2, not 3—not suitable for 'always round up'. Option 3 (floor) rounds DOWN, losing fractional cents. Option 4 (abs) just removes negative signs; it doesn't round. For financial calculations requiring 'always round up', math.ceil() is the correct choice.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Math Module Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Unix epoch, and why do computers use this as a reference point for time measurement?",
      options: [
        "The first computer timestamp ever recorded",
        "The moment Python was first released worldwide",
        "The date international timezones were standardized",
        "January 1 1970 UTC chosen for simplicity"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The Unix epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. This date was chosen when Unix was created for simplicity and consistency—it's an arbitrary but universally agreed-upon reference point. All timestamps are 'seconds since epoch'. Option 2 is incorrect—Python was released in 1991. Option 3 is false—timezones predate epoch. Option 4 is incorrect—computers existed before 1970. Using a single reference point (epoch) allows global time synchronization and simple duration calculations via subtraction.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Time and Epoch Concepts"
    },
    {
      question: "You call time.time() twice with 5 seconds between calls. Which operation correctly calculates the elapsed time?",
      options: [
        "Subtract first timestamp from second timestamp",
        "Add both timestamps and divide result",
        "Convert timestamps to strings then compare",
        "Use modulo operator to find remainder"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Subtracting the first timestamp from the second gives elapsed seconds: end_time - start_time = duration. Since timestamps are floats representing 'seconds since epoch', subtraction yields the difference (elapsed time). Option 2 (adding and dividing) produces meaningless results. Option 3 (string comparison) doesn't calculate numeric duration. Option 4 (modulo) finds remainders, not elapsed time. Timestamp subtraction is the standard pattern for measuring durations in Python.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Time and Epoch Concepts"
    },
    {
      question: "A time tuple from time.localtime() includes tm_wday = 6. What day of the week does this represent?",
      options: [
        "Saturday, since weeks start on Sunday",
        "Sunday, since Python uses zero for Monday",
        "The sixth day since epoch started",
        "Invalid value causing an error message"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "In Python's time tuples, tm_wday uses 0-6 indexing where 0=Monday and 6=Sunday. So tm_wday=6 means Sunday. Option 2 is incorrect—6 is not Saturday; Saturday is 5. Option 3 is false—tm_wday represents day of the week, not days since epoch. Option 4 is incorrect—6 is a valid weekday value. Understanding Python's Monday=0 convention is essential for calendar calculations and scheduling logic.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Time and Epoch Concepts"
    },
    {
      question: "Python 3.14 introduced date.strptime() as a new class method. How does this improve date parsing compared to previous versions?",
      options: [
        "Handles multiple formats in single function",
        "Automatically detects format without specifying codes",
        "Parses directly to date objects without datetime",
        "Validates timezone information during string parsing"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Before Python 3.14, you had to use datetime.strptime() and then extract the date component. The new date.strptime() returns a date object directly, simplifying the code. Option 2 is incorrect—you still provide format codes like '%Y-%m-%d'. Option 3 is false—each call handles one format; you'd need multiple calls for multiple formats. Option 4 is incorrect—date objects don't store timezone info. This new method reduces code complexity for date-only parsing.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Date and Time Objects (Python 3.14)"
    },
    {
      question: "You create datetime.now() without arguments. What critical issue does this create for global applications?",
      options: [
        "Returns date only without time component",
        "Rounds microseconds to nearest full second",
        "Uses server timezone instead of UTC",
        "Creates naive datetime without timezone information"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "datetime.now() without arguments creates a naive datetime (tzinfo=None), meaning it has no timezone context. For global apps, this is ambiguous—'2:30 PM' where? NYC? Tokyo? UTC? Option 2 is incorrect—now() includes microseconds. Option 3 is partially true but misses the core issue (naive vs aware). Option 4 is false—now() returns full datetime with time. Always use datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timezone-aware objects that can be properly converted.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Date and Time Objects (Python 3.14)"
    },
    {
      question: "When parsing user input '11/09/2025', which format code correctly interprets this as November 9, 2025 in US format?",
      options: [
        "Use format %d/%m/%Y for day-month-year parsing",
        "Use format %m/%d/%Y for month-day-year parsing",
        "Use format %Y/%m/%d for year-month-day parsing",
        "Use format %b/%d/%Y for abbreviated month names"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "In US format, dates are month/day/year, so %m/%d/%Y correctly parses 11/09/2025 as November 9, 2025. %m=month (11), %d=day (09), %Y=year (2025). Option 2 (%d/%m/%Y) is European format, interpreting this as September 11. Option 3 (%Y/%m/%d) expects year first. Option 4 (%b) expects abbreviated month names like 'Nov', not numeric months. Always clarify date format with users to prevent US/European confusion.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Date and Time Objects (Python 3.14)"
    },
    {
      question: "You store meeting times in your database. Why should you always store them in UTC rather than local timezones?",
      options: [
        "UTC provides universal reference avoiding DST complexity",
        "UTC requires less storage space than offset",
        "UTC automatically converts to all timezones",
        "UTC is the only format databases support"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Storing in UTC provides a universal, unchanging reference point. Local timezones have DST transitions where clocks 'spring forward' (hour doesn't exist) or 'fall back' (hour exists twice), creating ambiguity. UTC never changes. Option 2 is incorrect—storage size is identical. Option 3 is false—you must manually convert UTC to local times. Option 4 is incorrect—databases support many formats. The pattern: store UTC internally, convert to local timezone only for display to users.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Date and Time Objects (Python 3.14)"
    },
    {
      question: "AI generated code using 'for i in range(len(items)): process(items[i])'. What more Pythonic pattern should you request?",
      options: [
        "Request list comprehension for faster execution",
        "Request enumerate for index and value together",
        "Request while loop for better performance",
        "Request direct iteration using for item in"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Direct iteration 'for item in items:' is most Pythonic when you don't need indices—it's simpler and more readable than indexing. Option 2 (enumerate) is correct IF you need both index and value, but the question doesn't indicate that need. Option 3 (while loop) is less idiomatic for iterating collections. Option 4 (list comprehension) is for creating new lists, not processing items with side effects. When reviewing AI code, recognize C-style indexing and request direct iteration for cleaner Python.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Date/Time Formatting and Manipulation"
    },
    {
      question: "You format datetime(2025, 11, 9, 14, 30, 0) using strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'). What standard does this output follow?",
      options: [
        "RFC 2822 email header date format",
        "Unix timestamp format for epoch seconds",
        "ISO 8601 international date time standard",
        "SQL datetime format for database storage"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The format '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' produces ISO 8601 format: 2025-11-09T14:30:00. The 'T' separates date and time, and components are zero-padded. ISO 8601 is the international standard for datetime interchange. Option 2 (Unix timestamp) is a numeric seconds value, not this format. Option 3 (RFC 2822) uses format like 'Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:30:00 +0000'. Option 4 (SQL) often uses space instead of 'T'. Use ISO 8601 for APIs and data storage.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Date/Time Formatting and Manipulation"
    },
    {
      question: "You need to calculate a project deadline 45 days and 6 hours from today. What's the correct approach using datetime?",
      options: [
        "Add timedelta(days=45, hours=6) to current datetime",
        "Multiply datetime by 45 then add hours",
        "Convert datetime to string and parse result",
        "Use separate additions for days and hours"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Create timedelta(days=45, hours=6) and add it to datetime: deadline = now + timedelta(...). Timedelta handles all calendar complexity (month boundaries, leap years, etc.) in one operation. Option 2 is incorrect—you can't multiply datetime objects. Option 3 (string conversion) is inefficient and error-prone. Option 4 works but is unnecessarily verbose; timedelta accepts multiple units simultaneously. Timedelta arithmetic is the Pythonic way to manipulate dates.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Date/Time Formatting and Manipulation"
    },
    {
      question: "You subtract two datetime objects: duration = end - start. What type is the duration variable?",
      options: [
        "float representing seconds between the times",
        "timedelta object representing the time difference",
        "datetime object showing the end time",
        "int representing days between the dates"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Subtracting two datetime objects returns a timedelta object, which represents duration. You can then extract components: duration.days (complete days), duration.seconds (remaining seconds after days), duration.total_seconds() (entire duration in seconds). Option 2 (float) would require calling .total_seconds(). Option 3 (datetime) is incorrect—subtraction produces duration, not a point in time. Option 4 (int days) would require accessing duration.days. Understanding timedelta is essential for duration calculations.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Date/Time Formatting and Manipulation"
    },
    {
      question: "A meeting scheduled for 14:30 UTC needs conversion to US/Eastern (UTC-5). What is the correct local time?",
      options: [
        "10:30 accounting for daylight saving adjustment",
        "19:30 since Eastern is five hours ahead",
        "14:30 since UTC is the reference",
        "09:30 since Eastern is five hours behind"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "UTC-5 means 5 hours BEHIND UTC. So 14:30 UTC minus 5 hours = 09:30 Eastern. Option 2 gets the direction wrong (ahead vs behind). Option 3 ignores the offset entirely. Option 4 incorrectly adds an extra hour; the question specifies UTC-5 (the offset already accounts for DST if applicable). When converting timezones, negative offsets mean subtract from UTC, positive offsets mean add to UTC. Use astimezone() to let Python handle this automatically.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Date/Time Formatting and Manipulation"
    },
    {
      question: "You use datetime.astimezone(target_tz) to convert between timezones. What does astimezone() adjust?",
      options: [
        "Only the time value without changing offset",
        "Only the timezone label without changing time",
        "Both the time value and timezone offset",
        "Converts to string representation automatically"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "astimezone() adjusts BOTH the displayed time value AND the timezone offset to represent the same moment in a different timezone. If 14:30 UTC becomes 09:30 EST, both the hour value (14→09) and the offset (+00:00→-05:00) change. Option 2 is incorrect—merely changing labels without adjusting time would be wrong. Option 3 is backwards. Option 4 is false—astimezone() returns a datetime object, not a string. This method ensures you're showing the same moment in different local times.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Date/Time Formatting and Manipulation"
    },
    {
      question: "You're building a meeting scheduler for NYC, London, and Tokyo offices. What's the correct storage and display strategy?",
      options: [
        "Store meeting time in UTC convert for display",
        "Store meeting time in NYC timezone always",
        "Store separate times for each office location",
        "Store meeting time as Unix timestamp integer"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Store ALL times in UTC as the universal reference, then convert to each office's local timezone for display. This prevents ambiguity and handles DST correctly. Option 2 (store NYC) creates issues—NYC has DST transitions; UTC doesn't. Option 3 (separate times) is redundant and error-prone; they're the same moment. Option 4 (timestamp integer) loses datetime functionality; timestamps work but are less readable. The professional pattern: UTC internally, local timezone externally.",

    },
    {
      question: "Python 3.14's calendar.month(2025, 11) displays today's date in color in your terminal. How does this feature work?",
      options: [
        "Python detects your screen settings automatically",
        "Python embeds ANSI color codes terminals interpret",
        "Terminal must be configured with special plugin",
        "Color requires installing separate calendar module"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Python 3.14 embeds ANSI escape sequences (color codes) in the output string. Modern terminals interpret these codes and display colors. Python determines 'today' using datetime.date.today() and highlights that date. Option 2 is partially true but not the mechanism—ANSI codes are terminal-independent. Option 3 is incorrect—modern terminals support ANSI natively. Option 4 is false—calendar is built-in. This automatic highlighting is a native Python 3.14 feature requiring no configuration.",

    {
      question: "You need to determine the first weekday of November 2025 for scheduling logic. Which calendar function provides this?",
      options: [
        "calendar.firstweekday returns week start preference",
        "calendar.month returns formatted calendar string",
        "calendar.weekday returns zero-indexed day number",
        "calendar.monthrange returns only day count"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "calendar.weekday(year, month, day) returns the weekday as 0-6 (0=Monday, 6=Sunday). For November 1, 2025: calendar.weekday(2025, 11, 1) returns 5 (Saturday). Option 2 (month) displays calendar text, doesn't return weekday number. Option 3 (firstweekday) returns the user's week start preference (Mon vs Sun), not a specific date's weekday. Option 4 (monthrange) returns (first_weekday, num_days) tuple—close but returns two values, not just weekday. Use weekday() for single date lookups.",

    {
      question: "You're calculating projectile trajectory: sin and cos of launch angle determine vertical and horizontal components. Why must you convert degrees to radians first?",
      options: [
        "Radians automatically convert to screen coordinates",
        "Radians provide better precision than degrees",
        "Degrees cause overflow errors in calculations",
        "Python math functions require radians not degrees"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Python's math.sin(), math.cos(), and math.tan() require angles in RADIANS, not degrees. One full rotation = 2π radians = 360 degrees. Use math.radians(degrees) to convert before calling trig functions. Option 2 is misleading—precision isn't the issue; it's the required unit. Option 3 is false—degrees don't cause overflow. Option 4 is incorrect—radians have nothing to do with screen coordinates. Always convert degrees→radians using math.radians() before trigonometric calculations.",
      source: "Lesson 5: Calendar and Advanced Math"

    {
      question: "You calculate math.log(1000) versus math.log10(1000). Both are valid, but which should you use for decibel calculations?",
      options: [
        "math.log since natural logarithm is standard",
        "math.log10 since decibels use base ten scale",
        "Either works as long as consistent",
        "Neither since decibels require logarithm base two"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Decibels are defined as 10 * log₁₀(intensity_ratio), specifically using base-10 logarithm (math.log10). Natural logarithm (math.log, base e) produces different numeric results. Option 2 is incorrect for decibels—natural log is for continuous growth, not sound scales. Option 3 is false—using the wrong logarithm base changes the numeric result entirely. Option 4 is incorrect—decibels use base 10, not base 2. Scientific formulas specify which logarithm base to use; use math.log10() for decibels.",

        "Equals 120 since factorial multiplies decreasing integers",
        "Equals 25 since factorial squares the input",
        "Equals 10 since factorial doubles input",
        "Equals 5 since factorial returns input unchanged"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "math.factorial(5) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Factorials grow explosively because you multiply many consecutive integers: 10! = 3,628,800, 20! > 2 trillion. This explosive growth makes factorials useful for counting permutations and combinations. Option 2 (squaring) would give 25. Option 3 (doubling) would give 10. Option 4 (identity) would give 5. Understanding factorial growth helps you recognize when calculations might produce very large numbers.",

      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Setting current_min = math.inf ensures that ANY real value in the dataset will be less than infinity, so the first comparison succeeds. If the dataset is empty, current_min remains inf, signaling 'no minimum found'. Option 2 is unrelated—infinity doesn't prevent division errors. Option 3 is incorrect—inf doesn't convert other values. Option 4 is misleading—NaN (not infinity) typically marks missing data. Using infinity as sentinel value is a common pattern for min/max algorithms.",

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "math.isnan(value) is the ONLY reliable way to test for NaN. NaN has the unique property that NaN != NaN (it doesn't equal itself), so option 2 (== math.nan) always returns False. Option 3 (> 0) is false—NaN comparisons always return False. Option 4 (string conversion) is unreliable and slow. NaN represents undefined results like 0/0 or sqrt(-1). Always use math.isnan() for validation.",

        "Combining improves performance through caching mechanism",
        "Separation allows skipping time if not needed"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Separating date and time parsing provides clarity—each function handles one concern. You can validate date format separately from time format, giving users better error messages ('Invalid date format' vs 'Invalid time format'). Option 2 is false—you COULD use datetime.strptime() for both together. Option 3 is incorrect—no performance difference. Option 4 is a benefit but not the primary design reason. This separation follows Single Responsibility Principle, making code easier to test and debug.",

      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The code stores UTC+5:30 as 5.5 in the timezone_map dictionary, then splits: hours = int(5.5) = 5, minutes = int(0.5 * 60) = 30, creating timedelta(hours=5, minutes=30). Option 2 is incorrect—no 'special' object; timedelta handles minutes. Option 3 (rounding) would lose the 30-minute component entirely. Option 4 (minutes first) would work but isn't the implementation shown. This pattern handles any fractional hour offset correctly.",

      explanation: "Negative timedelta means the first datetime is AFTER the second—deadline was 2 days ago. The subtraction is correct; the negative tells you direction. You might display 'Deadline passed 2 days ago'. Option 2 (error) misunderstands—negative deltas are valid. Option 3 is false—timedelta can be negative. Option 4 is backwards—negative means past. Always check if timedelta is positive (future) or negative (past) when displaying countdown/elapsed messages.",

      question: "calendar.month(2025, 11) displays Monday as the first day of the week. How can you change the week to start on Sunday?",

        "Use calendar.setfirstweekday to change week start",

        "Import calendar with SUNDAY constant enabled",
        "Week start cannot be changed Python default"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "calendar.setfirstweekday(6) sets Sunday (6) as the first day of the week for subsequent calendar displays. This affects module-wide behavior. Option 2 is incorrect—month() doesn't have a parameter for this. Option 3 is false—no import constant controls this. Option 4 is incorrect—week start is configurable. Different locales prefer different week starts (US: Sunday, Europe: Monday); setfirstweekday() accommodates this.",

      question: "You calculate math.degrees(math.pi) and get 180.0. Why is π radians equal to 180 degrees?",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "π radians = half a circle = 180 degrees. A full circle is 2π radians = 360 degrees. The conversion: degrees = radians × (180/π). This relationship comes from circle geometry, not arbitrary definition. Option 2 is vague and incorrect. Option 3 is misleading—π ≈ 3.14159, not 180. Option 4 is true but doesn't explain WHY. Understanding the circle relationship (π = half rotation) helps you conceptualize radian-degree conversions.",

        "Dictionary provides O(1) lookup and stores offset",
        "List cannot store string timezone names",
        "Dictionary automatically sorts timezone names alphabetically",

      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Dictionary offers O(1) constant-time lookup ('US/Eastern' in timezone_map is fast) AND stores the offset value (timezone_map['US/Eastern'] = -5). A list would require O(n) linear search and wouldn't store offsets. Option 2 is false—lists can store strings. Option 3 is incorrect—dictionaries don't auto-sort (though you can sort keys). Option 4 is misleading—validation is simple with either structure. The dual benefit (fast lookup + value storage) makes dictionaries ideal for this use case.",
