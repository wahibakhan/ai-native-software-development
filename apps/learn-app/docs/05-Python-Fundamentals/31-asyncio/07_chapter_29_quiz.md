  questions={[    {
      question: "You're building a weather dashboard that fetches from 10 APIs, each taking 2 seconds. Using asyncio.gather(), how long will the total fetch take compared to sequential execution?",
      options: [
        "Sequential: 20s, Concurrent: ~2s (max delay of all tasks)",
        "Sequential: 20s, Concurrent: 20s (GIL prevents speedup)",
        "Sequential: 20s, Concurrent: ~10s (half the time)",
        "Sequential: 20s, Concurrent: varies based on CPU cores"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. With asyncio.gather(), all 10 API calls run concurrently (overlapping in time). The total time is approximately the longest single operation (2s), not the sum (20s). This is because I/O-bound tasks can pause with await, allowing the event loop to switch between them. Sequential execution would wait for each call to complete before starting the next (2+2+2...=20s). The GIL doesn't prevent concurrency for I/O-bound work (option 2 is wrong). Option 3's 'half the time' has no basis. Option 4 is incorrect because I/O concurrency doesn't depend on CPU cores. This demonstrates the fundamental asyncio value proposition from Lesson 1: Asyncio Foundations.",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you call an async function without using await or asyncio.run()?",
      options: [
        "Executes immediately and returns the result",
        "Returns a coroutine object but doesn't execute the function",
        "Raises SyntaxError because async requires await",
        "Automatically schedules on default event loop"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Calling an async function without await returns a coroutine object—a promise of future execution—but doesn't actually run the function. You'll see output like '<coroutine object func_name at 0x...>' and get a RuntimeWarning: 'coroutine was never awaited.' To execute, you must either await it (inside another async function) or use asyncio.run() (from sync context). Option 2 is wrong—async functions never execute immediately without await. Option 3 is wrong—it's a runtime warning, not a syntax error. Option 4 is wrong—there's no 'default event loop' that auto-schedules. This is a common beginner mistake covered in Lesson 1: Asyncio Foundations.",

    },
    {
      question: "Your AI agent processes text with heavy NLP analysis (CPU-intensive). You wrap it in async def and use asyncio.gather() to run 4 analyses concurrently. What performance do you expect?",
      options: [
        "2x speedup due to partial parallelism",
        "4x speedup because 4 tasks run in parallel",
        "No speedup; CPU work doesn't benefit from asyncio",
        "Performance worse due to event loop overhead"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Asyncio provides concurrency (task switching) for I/O-bound work, not parallelism for CPU-bound work. CPU-intensive NLP analysis has no I/O wait points where await can yield control. The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously, so wrapping CPU work in async def doesn't help. All 4 tasks still run sequentially on one CPU core. Option 4 is partially true (overhead exists) but the key issue is no parallelism. Option 2 is wrong—asyncio doesn't parallelize CPU work. Option 3 is wrong for the same reason. To parallelize CPU work, use InterpreterPoolExecutor (Lesson 4) or ProcessPoolExecutor. This fundamental limitation is explained in Lesson 1: I/O-Bound vs CPU-Bound Tasks.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Asyncio Foundations — I/O vs CPU Task Recognition"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the key difference between concurrency (asyncio) and parallelism (InterpreterPoolExecutor)?",
      options: [
        "Concurrency uses threads; Parallelism uses processes",
        "Concurrency requires async def; Parallelism works with def",
        "Concurrency is for I/O; Parallelism is for CPU (both are correct but secondary)",
        "Concurrency: tasks switch on one core; Parallelism: tasks run on multiple cores simultaneously"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Concurrency means multiple tasks make progress by switching execution on one CPU core (cooperative multitasking). When task A hits await, task B runs. Parallelism means multiple tasks literally run at the same time on different CPU cores. Asyncio provides concurrency (event loop switches tasks). InterpreterPoolExecutor provides parallelism (separate interpreters on separate cores). Option 2 is a syntax distinction, not the conceptual difference. Option 3 is true (I/O vs CPU) but describes the use case, not the core distinction. Option 4 is wrong—asyncio doesn't use threads (it uses one thread with an event loop), and InterpreterPoolExecutor uses separate interpreters (not processes). This critical distinction is taught in Lesson 1: Concurrency vs Parallelism.",

    {
      question: "You need to fetch user data from 5 services concurrently. What's the correct pattern using asyncio.create_task()?",
      options: [
        "Schedule all tasks first, then await results",
        "Await each task immediately after creating it",
        "Create tasks inside a for loop with await",
        "Use create_task() but don't await the results"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. The pattern is: create all tasks (schedule them), THEN await results. This allows all tasks to start running concurrently. Example: 'tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch(i)) for i in range(5)]' (all start immediately), then 'results = [await t for t in tasks]' (collect results). Option 2 defeats concurrency—awaiting immediately blocks, so tasks run sequentially. Option 3 has the same problem (await inside loop = sequential). Option 4 creates tasks but never gets results (memory leak, RuntimeWarning). The key insight: create_task() schedules immediately, await collects later. This pattern is demonstrated in Lesson 2: Understanding Task Scheduling with create_task().",
      source: "Lesson 2: Concurrent Tasks — create_task() Pattern"
    },
    {
      question: "When should you use asyncio.gather() instead of asyncio.create_task() for multiple concurrent operations?",
      options: [
        "When you need fine-grained control over task cancellation",
        "When collecting all results at once and you don't need individual task references",
        "When tasks have different error handling requirements",
        "When you need to inspect task state during execution"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. asyncio.gather() is a convenience wrapper for 'schedule multiple coroutines and collect all results.' It's concise: 'results = await asyncio.gather(fetch(1), fetch(2), fetch(3))' vs creating and awaiting individual tasks. Use gather() when you want all results together and don't need task references. Use create_task() when you need: fine-grained control (cancel specific tasks), task inspection (task.done(), task.result()), or different handling per task. Options 2-4 describe scenarios where create_task() is BETTER (individual task references needed). Gather is for simplicity; create_task is for control. This tradeoff is explained in Lesson 2: Collecting Results with asyncio.gather().",

    },
    {
      question: "What is the key advantage of asyncio.TaskGroup() (Python 3.11+) over asyncio.gather()?",
      options: [
        "TaskGroup() allows collecting results from exceptions",
        "TaskGroup() runs faster than gather() for many tasks",
        "Fail-fast behavior: if one task fails, all others are automatically cancelled",
        "TaskGroup() works with synchronous functions, gather() requires async"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. TaskGroup implements structured concurrency with fail-fast semantics. If any task in the group raises an exception, TaskGroup immediately cancels all other tasks and raises ExceptionGroup. This is all-or-nothing execution. In contrast, gather(return_exceptions=True) continues running other tasks even when one fails (best-effort). Option 2 is wrong—performance is similar. Option 3 is backwards—gather() can collect exceptions with return_exceptions=True. Option 4 is wrong—both require async functions. Use TaskGroup when atomicity matters (all succeed or all fail). Use gather() when partial success is acceptable (resilient systems). This pattern is taught in Lesson 2: TaskGroup: Modern Structured Concurrency.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Concurrent Tasks — TaskGroup() Structured Concurrency"
    },
    {
      question: "You're using asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True) to fetch from 10 APIs. Three APIs fail with ConnectionError. What do you receive?",
      options: [
        "First ConnectionError raised immediately, stopping other tasks",
        "ExceptionGroup containing all 3 failures",
        "Only the 7 successful results (failed ones omitted)",
        "A list of 10 items: 7 successful results and 3 ConnectionError exceptions"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. With gather(return_exceptions=True), the result is a list matching input order: successful results as values, failed tasks as Exception objects. You get: [result, result, ConnectionError(...), result, ...] with 10 total items. You must manually check 'isinstance(item, Exception)' to identify failures. Option 2 is wrong—ExceptionGroup is from TaskGroup, not gather. Option 3 is wrong—failed tasks remain in the list as exceptions, not omitted. Option 4 describes default gather() behavior (return_exceptions=False), not the True case. This resilience pattern is key for production systems where partial success is acceptable (backup services, multi-source aggregation).

      question: "Your async API client occasionally hangs waiting for responses. You add asyncio.timeout(5) context manager. What exception do you catch when timeout occurs?",
      options: [
        "asyncio.CancelledError",
        "asyncio.TimeoutError",
        "TimeoutError (built-in)",
        "asyncio.TimeoutException"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. The asyncio.timeout() context manager (Python 3.11+) raises asyncio.TimeoutError when the time limit is exceeded. Pattern: 'async with asyncio.timeout(5): await slow_operation()' raises TimeoutError if it takes >5s. This is different from asyncio.CancelledError (option 2), which occurs when a task is explicitly cancelled (task.cancel() or TaskGroup cancellation). Option 3 (built-in TimeoutError) exists but asyncio uses asyncio.TimeoutError specifically. Option 4 doesn't exist. This defensive pattern is critical for production systems to prevent indefinite hangs. Always catch and handle timeouts gracefully (retry, fallback, or fail explicitly).

    {
      question: "What's the difference between asyncio.TimeoutError (from timeout context) and asyncio.CancelledError (from task cancellation)?",
      options: [
        "TimeoutError: operation exceeded time limit; CancelledError: task cancelled externally",
        "Both are identical; asyncio uses them interchangeably",
        "TimeoutError for I/O operations; CancelledError for CPU operations",
        "TimeoutError is recoverable; CancelledError always crashes the program"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. TimeoutError indicates the operation took too long (you set a timeout and it expired). CancelledError indicates external cancellation (another task called task.cancel(), or TaskGroup cancelled due to another task's failure). They require different handling: TimeoutError might warrant retry (transient network slowness); CancelledError usually means cleanup time (system is shutting down or coordinated cancellation). Option 2 is wrong—they're distinct exceptions. Option 3 is wrong—both apply to any async operation. Option 4 is wrong—both are recoverable (you can catch them). Understanding this distinction helps design resilient systems that respond appropriately to different failure modes. Explained in Lesson 3: Exception Handling in Async Code.",

      question: "You wrote async def fetch(): result = asyncio.sleep(1) and see RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'sleep' was never awaited. What's wrong?",
      options: [
        "async functions can't call sleep without yield",
        "Should use time.sleep(1) instead of asyncio.sleep(1)",
        "Forgot to import asyncio module",
        "Missing await keyword before asyncio.sleep(1)"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. asyncio.sleep() is a coroutine (async function). You must await it: 'await asyncio.sleep(1)'. Without await, you create a coroutine object but never execute it—it never pauses the function. The corrected code: 'async def fetch(): result = await asyncio.sleep(1)'. Option 2 is dangerous—time.sleep() blocks the entire event loop (no other tasks run). Option 3 is wrong—you'd get ImportError, not RuntimeWarning. Option 4 is nonsense (yield isn't relevant here). This is the most common async beginner mistake. The RuntimeWarning tells you: 'You created an awaitable but didn't await it.' Always await coroutines! Covered in Lesson 3: Common Mistakes — Never-Awaited Coroutines.",

      question: "Why is using time.sleep(2) inside an async function a problem?",
      options: [
        "time.sleep() is slower than asyncio.sleep()",
        "time.sleep() raises SyntaxError in async functions",
        "Blocks the event loop; no other tasks can run during sleep",
        "time.sleep() only works with threading, not asyncio"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. time.sleep() is a blocking call—it freezes the entire thread, including the event loop. During time.sleep(2), NO other async tasks can run (they're all blocked). This defeats asyncio's concurrency. Use await asyncio.sleep(2) instead—it yields control to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run. Option 2 is wrong—no syntax error, just bad practice. Option 3 is wrong—speed is similar, the issue is blocking. Option 4 is wrong—time.sleep() works anywhere but blocks. This mistake is subtle because the code 'works' (doesn't crash) but kills performance. A system with 100 concurrent tasks using time.sleep becomes sequential. Always use await asyncio.sleep() in async code! Explained in Lesson 3: Common Mistake: Blocking the Event Loop.",

      question: "Your async API client retries failed requests. What pattern implements exponential backoff correctly?",
      options: [
        "Delay doubles after each retry: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s (with max cap)",
        "Delay decreases after each retry: 4s, 2s, 1s, 0.5s",
        "Delay stays constant: 2s between each retry",
        "Delay increases linearly: 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Exponential backoff means delay DOUBLES after each failure: retry 1 waits 1s, retry 2 waits 2s, retry 3 waits 4s, etc. This gives failing services increasing time to recover while avoiding 'thundering herd' (all clients retrying simultaneously). Best practice: add jitter (random variance) and max cap (prevent infinite growth to hours). Pattern: 'delay = min(initial_delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)'. Option 2 is backwards (decreasing makes no sense—give more time, not less). Option 3 (constant delay) is better than nothing but doesn't give escalating recovery time. Option 4 (linear) is less effective than exponential for transient failures. Exponential backoff is the industry standard for resilient systems. Taught in Lesson 3: Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff.",

        "Context manager for timeout control"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. A Future is an awaitable object representing a result that isn't available yet—a promise. You await it, and when the value arrives, the await completes. In practice, asyncio creates Futures internally: create_task() returns Task (Future subclass), gather() returns Future, executors return Futures. You rarely create Futures manually (asyncio.Future()). Option 2 is wrong—Futures don't replace async def. Option 3 is wrong—run_in_executor() returns a Future, but you don't create it yourself. Option 4 describes asyncio.timeout(), not Futures. Understanding Futures helps debug ('why is task.result() raising InvalidStateError?') but you primarily interact with them indirectly.

        "CPU-bound work (calculations, data processing)"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. The GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. For CPU-bound work (math, parsing, analysis), all threads are always ready to run, so the GIL becomes a bottleneck—only one runs while others wait. For I/O-bound work, threads naturally wait for I/O (network, disk), so the GIL matters less (one thread waits while another runs). Option 2 is wrong—I/O work can still benefit from threading/asyncio (one waits, another runs). Option 3 is wrong—impact is greater for CPU work. Option 4 is wrong—asyncio uses the same GIL, just one thread with an event loop. To escape GIL for CPU work: use InterpreterPoolExecutor (separate interpreters = separate GILs) or ProcessPoolExecutor. Explained in Lesson 4: What Is the GIL?",

        "Both perform identically (same time)"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. For CPU-bound work, ThreadPoolExecutor is SLOWER than sequential execution. Why? The GIL forces 4 threads to compete for access to the single interpreter. Only one runs at a time, but now you pay context-switching overhead (OS switching between threads). Benchmark shows: Sequential 4.5s, Threading 6.1s (slower!). Option 2 is the intuitive expectation, but wrong due to GIL. Option 3 is wrong for the same reason. Option 4 is wrong—threading adds overhead. This counterintuitive result demonstrates why understanding GIL matters.

Pipeline patterns overlap stages: while stage 1 fetches new data, stage 2 processes previous data, stage 3 stores earlier results—all happening concurrently. This maximizes throughput by keeping all resources busy (network, CPU, database). Batch processing fetches all, then processes all, then stores all (sequential stages). Pipelines achieve higher throughput at the cost of complexity (managing queues between stages). Option 2 is wrong—memory usage depends on queue depth, not the pattern choice.

Pattern: 'async with semaphore: await fetch_api()' ensures max 10 requests in flight at once. This prevents overwhelming servers (respecting rate limits), exhausting connection pools, or hitting OS resource limits (file descriptors). When 10 tasks are running, additional tasks wait at the semaphore until one completes. Option 2 is wrong—Semaphores don't manage CPU cores (use executor max_workers for that). Option 3 is wrong—Semaphores don't affect GIL. Option 4 is wrong—Semaphores are for resource limiting, not memory leak prevention.

If you exceed these, requests fail with 429 errors. Before hitting CPU, memory, or bandwidth limits, you'll hit API rate limits. Solution: use Semaphore to limit concurrency (e.g., max 5 concurrent LLM calls), implement retry with exponential backoff for 429 errors, and batch requests where possible. Option 2 is rarely the bottleneck (LLM processing happens server-side). Option 3 can be an issue for large context windows but is secondary to rate limits.

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. With 4 CPU cores, use 4 InterpreterPoolExecutor workers (1 worker per core). Batch size 8-16 balances memory (not all 100 in RAM) and overhead (not too many batches). Fetch within each batch is concurrent (I/O work). Processing is parallel (CPU work). Total time ≈ (100/16) batches × (100ms fetch + 500ms/4 process) ≈ 6.25 × 225ms ≈ 1.4s. Option 2 has 100 items in memory and long wait before processing starts. Option 3 underutilizes CPU (3 cores idle). Option 4 risks memory exhaustion and rate limits. This demonstrates hybrid optimization: match batch size to memory/rate limits, match workers to CPU cores.

      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Here's the flow: 1) loop.run_in_executor calls executor.submit(sync_func, arg), which returns a concurrent.futures.Future. 2) The asyncio event loop wraps this Future as an awaitable. 3) await pauses the current coroutine until the Future completes. 4) During the await, the event loop is FREE to run other tasks (not blocked). When the executor finishes, the result is returned. Option 2 is wrong—it doesn't change the function, just runs it elsewhere. Option 3 is wrong—it uses whatever executor you pass (could be InterpreterPoolExecutor). Option 4 is wrong—the event loop is NOT blocked (that's the whole point).

With 4 CPU cores, embedding time is 200ms × 1000 / 4 = 50 seconds. Total ≈ 50s (all other stages overlap with embedding). Option 2 is fantasy (can't process 1000 items in 280ms). Option 3 is sequential (no optimization). Option 4 is wrong—CPU (embedding) is the bottleneck, not fetch.

Circuit breaker has three states: 1) CLOSED: normal operation, requests flow through. 2) OPEN: too many failures detected, reject all requests immediately (fail-fast, give service time to recover). 3) HALF-OPEN: after timeout period, allow ONE test request; if successful → CLOSED, if failed → OPEN again. Prompt should specify: failure threshold (e.g., 5 consecutive failures), open duration (e.g., 60s), success threshold to close (e.g., 1 success). Option 2 is too vague.

This is pure latency reduction through overlap. Option 2 is wrong—asyncio doesn't make individual API calls faster (network speed is unchanged). Option 3 is wrong—error handling quality depends on your code, not sync vs async. Option 4 is wrong—memory usage is similar (might be slightly higher with many concurrent tasks). The win is: total wall-clock time approaches max(individual_calls), not sum(individual_calls).

The fix: store task references and await them: 'tasks = [create_task(f(i)) for i in range(1000)]; results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)' or use TaskGroup. Option 2 is wrong—no immediate crash.

Allocate most workers there (e.g., 4-8 InterpreterPoolExecutor workers). Fetch/store are I/O (fast with concurrency, need fewer workers or just asyncio concurrency). Example: fetch with 10 concurrent tasks (asyncio), transform with 8 workers (InterpreterPoolExecutor), store with 5 concurrent tasks (asyncio). Option 2 is wrong—fetch being fast is GOOD (not the bottleneck). Option 3 is wrong—store being fast is GOOD. Option 4 wastes resources (I/O stages don't need workers).

      explanation: "The correct answer is option 1. Jitter adds small random variance to prevent thundering herd (all clients retrying at exactly the same time). Pattern: calculate exponential delay (1s, 2s, 4s), then add jitter (0-10% random). Example: 'jitter = random.uniform(0, delay * 0.1); actual_delay = min(delay + jitter, max_cap)'. This spreads retries over time. Option 2 is too chaotic (random 0-100% defeats exponential pattern). Option 3 abandons exponential backoff entirely.
