  questions={[    {
      question: "Why is Python considered the 'lingua franca' of AI development compared to other programming languages?",
      options: [
        "Python is the fastest language for computation tasks",
        "Python has readable syntax and extensive AI libraries",
        "Python requires less memory than other programming languages",
        "Python was specifically designed only for machine learning"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Python dominates AI development because of its highly readable syntax (almost like English) and massive ecosystem of AI libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, etc.). While Python is not the fastest language (languages like C++ are faster), its readability allows AI systems and developers to understand code intent more clearly. Python wasn't designed exclusively for machine learning—it's a general-purpose language that happens to excel at AI because of its ecosystem and clarity. Memory efficiency is not Python's primary advantage.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What Is Python?"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary advantage of Python's readability for AI-Driven Development?",
      options: [
        "Python automatically fixes all syntax errors instantly",
        "Python code executes faster than other languages",
        "Readable code uses less disk storage space",
        "AI assistants understand code intent more accurately"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The key advantage of Python's readability is that AI assistants can understand code intent more accurately. When you write 'print(message)' instead of 'console.log(message)', the intent is clearer, making AI collaboration more effective. Python does not execute faster than languages like C++—it's actually slower. Readability has no impact on disk storage, and Python does not automatically fix syntax errors (you must debug them). The readability-AI partnership is what makes Python ideal for AI-Driven Development.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What Is Python?"
    },
    {
      question: "Which real-world AI system demonstrates Python's capability to handle production-scale applications?",
      options: [
        "Spotify's recommendation engine analyzing listening patterns",
        "Microsoft Word's spell checker functionality",
        "Basic calculator applications on smartphones",
        "Simple alarm clock applications on devices"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Spotify's recommendation engine is a real-world example of Python powering production AI at scale, analyzing billions of listening patterns using Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn). Microsoft Word's spell checker is not primarily Python-based. Calculator and alarm clock apps are far too simple to demonstrate Python's AI capabilities—they don't involve machine learning or data analysis. The lesson emphasizes production systems (ChatGPT, Spotify, Tesla) to show Python handles massive, real-world AI workloads, not trivial applications.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What Is Python?"
    },
    {
      question: "How do type hints in Python relate to the AI-Driven Development methodology taught in Chapters 1-12?",
      options: [
        "Type hints replace the need for comments",
        "Type hints automatically generate all program code",
        "Type hints describe intent like specifications do",
        "Type hints make Python code execute faster"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Type hints describe intent, just like the specifications you learned in Chapters 9-11. When you write 'age: int = 25', you're saying 'I intend age to be a whole number'—this is specification-first thinking. Type hints don't automatically generate code (you still write your programs), they don't replace comments (comments explain why, type hints explain what), and they don't improve execution speed (Python doesn't enforce type hints at runtime). Type hints are your first practice with Spec-Driven Development.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What Is Python?"
    },
    {
      question: "What misconception about Python learning does the chapter explicitly address?",
      options: [
        "Python cannot build web applications",
        "You must memorize all syntax before coding",
        "Python is slower than all other languages",
        "Python requires expensive commercial licenses"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter directly addresses the misconception that you need to memorize all Python syntax before coding. The AI-native approach teaches ~20 core concepts deeply; AI knows the rest. This is the opposite of traditional 'memorize everything first' education. The chapter explicitly states Python builds web applications (Instagram, Spotify). While Python is slower than some languages, that's acknowledged, not a misconception. Python is open-source and free, so licensing concerns are not addressed.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What Is Python?"
    },
    {
      question: "On Windows, what critical step during Python installation is often missed, causing 'command not found' errors?",
      options: [
        "Restarting the computer immediately after installation",
        "Selecting the custom installation option",
        "Installing Python in Program Files directory",
        "Checking the box to add Python to PATH"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The critical step is checking 'Add Python to PATH' during installation. Without this, Windows can't find Python when you type 'python' in terminal, causing 'command not found' errors. Custom installation is optional, not required. Installing in Program Files vs elsewhere doesn't matter as long as PATH is correct. Restarting the computer is unnecessary for Python installation—PATH changes take effect in new terminal sessions. This checkbox is so important the lesson specifically warns: 'CRITICAL: Check this box.'",
      source: "Lesson 2: Installing Python 3.14+ on Your Computer"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does the chapter require Python 3.14+ specifically, rather than older versions like Python 3.8?",
      options: [
        "Newer versions have features used throughout Part 4",
        "Older versions are no longer available to download",
        "Python 3.14 is required by law for development",
        "Older versions contain dangerous security vulnerabilities"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The chapter requires Python 3.14+ because newer versions have features used throughout Part 4 (like improved type hints, pattern matching, etc.). Older versions lack these features, so code examples won't work. Older Python versions are still available—python.org maintains archives. There's no legal requirement to use Python 3.14. While older versions may have security issues, that's not the primary reason stated in the chapter—the focus is feature availability for learning.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Installing Python 3.14+ on Your Computer"
    },
    {
      question: "A Mac user runs 'python --version' and sees 'Python 2.7.16'. What should they try next?",
      options: [
        "Reinstall macOS to fix the Python version",
        "Immediately uninstall all Python versions completely",
        "Run 'python3 --version' to check Python 3 installation",
        "Accept Python 2.7 as sufficient for all lessons"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "On Mac, they should try 'python3 --version' because macOS often has Python 2.7 pre-installed as 'python', while Python 3 is accessible via 'python3'. This is normal Mac behavior. Uninstalling all Python versions is drastic and unnecessary—Mac needs Python 2 for system tools. Reinstalling macOS is extreme overkill for a version confusion. Python 2.7 is insufficient—the chapter requires Python 3.14+ for modern features. The lesson specifically notes this Mac-specific quirk.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Installing Python 3.14+ on Your Computer"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the correct way to verify Python installation works beyond just checking the version?",
      options: [
        "Restart computer and wait for confirmation message",
        "Open Python installer and click verify button",
        "Check if Python icon appears on desktop",
        "Run 'python -c \"print('Hello, Python!')\" and verify output"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct verification is running 'python -c \"print('Hello, Python!')\"' and confirming it outputs 'Hello, Python!'. This tests that Python not only exists but can execute code successfully. There's no 'verify button' in the installer—installers close after installation. Python doesn't create desktop icons. Restarting the computer doesn't provide confirmation—you need to actively test Python execution. The lesson uses this exact command as Step 4 in each platform's instructions.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Installing Python 3.14+ on Your Computer"
    },
    {
      question: "When troubleshooting Python installation errors with AI, what information should you provide for effective help?",
      options: [
        "Only the first three words of error",
        "Full error message and operating system version",
        "Your computer's purchase date and warranty status",
        "Screenshots of all programs you have installed"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "You should provide the complete error message and OS version. AI needs full context to diagnose platform-specific issues—partial error messages miss critical details. Providing only the first three words is insufficient for diagnosis. Computer purchase date and warranty are irrelevant to Python errors. Screenshots of all programs are excessive and unhelpful—focus on the specific error. The lesson emphasizes: 'provide complete error context (OS version, exact error message)'.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Installing Python 3.14+ on Your Computer"
    },
    {
      question: "What is a variable in Python programming?",
      options: [
        "A named container that holds data values",
        "A function that performs mathematical calculations",
        "A command that prints text to terminal",
        "A file extension indicating Python code"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "A variable is a named container that holds data. Think of it like a labeled drawer—you put data in, and you can retrieve it using the name. Variables are not functions (functions are actions), not commands (print is a command), and not file extensions (.py is the extension). The lesson uses the filing cabinet analogy: each drawer (variable) has a label (name) and holds something (value). This fundamental concept appears in every programming language.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "Which of the following correctly creates an integer variable with a type hint in Python?",
      options: [
        "int age = 25",
        "age int = 25",
        "age: int = 25",
        "age = int(25)"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct syntax is 'age: int = 25'. The colon separates the variable name from the type hint, then equals assigns the value. 'age int = 25' is wrong—missing the colon causes syntax error. 'int age = 25' is wrong—that's C/Java syntax, not Python. 'age = int(25)' is type conversion, not a type hint (it creates an integer but doesn't declare the type hint). Python's type hint syntax is: name: type = value.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "When should you use the 'float' type instead of 'int' for a variable?",
      options: [
        "When storing true or false boolean values only",
        "When the data contains any alphabetic text characters",
        "When you need whole numbers without decimal points",
        "When the data represents decimal numbers like prices"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Use 'float' for decimal numbers like prices ($19.99), heights (5.7 feet), temperatures (98.6°F). Use 'str' (not float) for alphabetic text. Use 'int' (not float) for whole numbers without decimals like age or count. Use 'bool' (not float) for true/false values. The lesson shows: 'price: float = 19.99' and 'height: float = 5.7'. Float stands for 'floating-point number'—the decimal point 'floats' to different positions.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "According to PEP 8 style guidelines, which variable name is correctly formatted?",
      options: [
        "userName",
        "user_name",
        "UserName",
        "USER_NAME"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "PEP 8 requires 'user_name' (lowercase with underscores) for regular variables. 'userName' is camelCase (used in JavaScript, not Python). 'UserName' is PascalCase (used for Python class names, not variables). 'USER_NAME' is uppercase (used for Python constants like 'MAX_SIZE = 100', not regular variables). The lesson explicitly shows: 'user_name = \"Alice\"  # ✓ Good' vs 'userName = \"Alice\"  # ✗ Not Python style'.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the 'isinstance()' function return when checking if a variable matches a type?",
      options: [
        "An error message if types do not match",
        "The actual type of the variable as text",
        "True if the variable is the specified type",
        "The converted value in the specified type"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "'isinstance()' returns True if the variable is the specified type, False otherwise. For example, 'isinstance(age, int)' returns True if age is an integer. It does not return the type as text (that's what 'type()' does). It does not raise an error on mismatch—it just returns False. It does not convert values—it only checks types. The lesson shows: 'print(isinstance(age, int))  # Output: True' and 'print(isinstance(age, str))  # Output: False'.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does the chapter emphasize that type hints are 'mandatory, not optional' for this course?",
      options: [
        "Type hints are practice for specification-first thinking",
        "Python will refuse to run code without them",
        "Type hints make Python code execute significantly faster",
        "Type hints automatically prevent all possible errors"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Type hints are mandatory in this course as practice for specification-first thinking—declaring intent before implementation (the foundation of Spec-Driven Development in Part 5). Python does NOT refuse to run code without type hints—they're optional in standard Python. Type hints don't improve execution speed—Python doesn't enforce them at runtime. Type hints don't prevent all errors—they document intent, but Python doesn't validate them automatically. The lesson states: 'type hints aren't \"advanced Python\"—they're foundational specifications.'",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of the 'bool' data type in Python?",
      options: [
        "To store whole numbers without decimal points",
        "To store true or false values for decisions",
        "To store text strings with alphabetic characters",
        "To store decimal numbers with floating points"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The 'bool' (boolean) type stores True or False values, used for yes/no decisions and condition checking. Whole numbers without decimals are 'int', not bool. Text strings are 'str', not bool. Decimal numbers are 'float', not bool. The lesson shows: 'is_student: bool = True', 'is_valid: bool = False', 'has_permission: bool = True'. Booleans are surprisingly useful for conditional logic, which students will learn in later chapters.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Variables and Type Hints – Describing Intent"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Python's indentation rules different from languages like JavaScript or Java?",
      options: [
        "Python indentation is purely for visual aesthetics only",
        "Python does not allow any indentation whatsoever",
        "Python requires curly braces around all code blocks",
        "Python uses spaces for structure instead of curly braces"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Python uses spaces (indentation) to define code structure, unlike JavaScript/Java which use curly braces {}. Python's indentation is syntactically significant—it's not optional. Python does not require curly braces—that's the point of using indentation instead. Indentation is not purely aesthetic—Python interprets it as structure. The lesson states: 'Python is unusual among programming languages in one fundamental way: it uses indentation (spaces) to show code structure.' Later chapters show how indentation controls if statements and loops.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Basic Syntax and Your First Programs"
    },
    {
      question: "According to PEP 8 standards, how many spaces should you use per indentation level in Python?",
      options: [
        "One tab character per level",
        "Two spaces per indentation level",
        "Four spaces per indentation level",
        "Eight spaces per indentation level"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "PEP 8 requires 4 spaces per indentation level. Not 2 spaces (some languages use this, not Python). Not tabs (tabs and spaces mixed cause IndentationError). Not 8 spaces (excessive and not standard). The lesson explicitly states: 'The Standard: Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Not 2 spaces, not tabs, not 3 spaces. Four spaces.' Modern code editors convert tabs to 4 spaces automatically.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Basic Syntax and Your First Programs"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary purpose of comments in Python code?",
      options: [
        "To explain why the code does something",
        "To make the code execute faster than usual",
        "To prevent Python from reading those lines entirely",
        "To automatically fix errors in the surrounding code"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Comments explain WHY code does something (the reasoning), not WHAT it does (that's obvious from the code itself). Comments don't affect execution speed—Python ignores them. While Python doesn't execute comments, saying 'prevent Python from reading' misunderstands their purpose—they're for humans. Comments don't fix errors—they're documentation. The lesson shows good vs bad comments: '# We subtract 1 because Python counts from 0' (explains why) vs '# Subtract 1 from current_position' (just repeats what).",
      source: "Lesson 4: Basic Syntax and Your First Programs"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the 'f' prefix in an f-string like 'f\"Hello {name}\"' indicate?",
      options: [
        "This string should be displayed in fixed-width font",
        "This is a function that will execute immediately",
        "This string contains only floating-point numbers",
        "This is a formatted string with variable interpolation"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The 'f' prefix indicates a formatted string (f-string) that allows variable interpolation using {} brackets. The 'f' does not mean function—f-strings are literals, not function calls. The 'f' doesn't relate to floating-point numbers—it works with any type. The 'f' has nothing to do with fonts—it's about string formatting. The lesson shows: 'print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old\")'. F-strings are the modern Python way to embed variables in text.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Basic Syntax and Your First Programs"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does the chapter recommend f-strings over string concatenation with '+' operators?",
      options: [
        "F-strings execute faster than all other methods",
        "F-strings are cleaner and easier to read",
        "String concatenation is not possible in Python 3",
        "The '+' operator is deprecated in Python 3.14"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "F-strings are cleaner and easier to read than concatenation. Compare: 'print(\"Name: \" + name + \" Age: \" + str(age))' vs 'print(f\"Name: {name} Age: {age}\")'. F-strings are not necessarily faster—readability is the main advantage. Concatenation still works in Python 3—it's not removed, just discouraged. The '+' operator is not deprecated—it's still valid Python, just not the modern best practice for string formatting. The lesson emphasizes: 'F-strings are cleaner, easier to read, and more professional.'",

        "run hello.py",
        "python hello.py",
        "open hello.py"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct command is 'python hello.py' (or 'python3 hello.py' on Mac/Linux). 'run hello.py' is not a valid terminal command—'run' is not a system command. 'execute hello.py' is not valid—'execute' is not a command. 'open hello.py' opens the file in a text editor, it doesn't run the code. The lesson shows this exact command in Step 3 of every example. On Mac/Linux, you may need 'python3' instead of 'python'.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Basic Syntax and Your First Programs"

    {
      question: "What happens when you mix tabs and spaces for indentation in Python code?",
      options: [
        "Python raises an IndentationError",
        "Python automatically converts tabs to spaces",
        "Python ignores the indentation completely",
        "The code runs but produces incorrect output"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Python raises an 'IndentationError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces' when you mix them. Python does not automatically convert tabs to spaces at runtime (though editors might during typing). Python doesn't ignore indentation—it's syntactically significant. The code won't run at all—Python stops with an error before execution. The lesson warns: 'If you accidentally mix tabs and spaces, Python will complain with an IndentationError.' Modern editors prevent this by converting tabs to spaces automatically.",

        "To make the code execute faster automatically",
        "To indicate the file contains Python code",
        "To enable automatic error detection and fixing",
        "To compress the file size for storage"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The '.py' extension indicates the file contains Python code, helping both humans and systems identify it. The extension doesn't affect execution speed—Python's interpreter determines that. The extension doesn't enable automatic error detection—you must run the code to find errors. The extension has nothing to do with file compression—.py files are plain text. The lesson states: 'The .py extension tells Python \"this is a Python file.\"' File extensions are metadata about content type.",

        "Type hints are not allowed with input variables",
        "Strings execute faster than integers in Python",
        "Integers cannot be displayed using print function",
        "The input function returns strings by default"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The 'input()' function always returns strings, regardless of what the user types. To use age as an integer, you'd need to convert it: 'age: int = int(input(\"Age?\"))'. Strings don't execute faster than integers—the capstone uses strings for simplicity, not speed. Integers can absolutely be printed—'print(25)' works fine. Type hints ARE allowed with input variables—the capstone uses 'name: str = input(...)'. The lesson keeps everything as strings to avoid introducing type conversion in this introductory chapter.",

    },
    {
      question: "What does the capstone project primarily demonstrate about the software development process?",

        "The specification-first design before coding approach",
        "How to memorize all Python syntax quickly",
        "That comments are unnecessary in small programs",
        "Type hints are optional for beginner projects"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The capstone demonstrates specification-first development: understand WHAT (specification), design HOW (planning), code and test (implementation), verify (validation). It does not teach syntax memorization—the focus is on applying concepts already learned. Comments are emphasized as mandatory, not unnecessary—the capstone requirements include 'Includes comments explaining sections'. Type hints are required, not optional—'Has type hints on all variables' is a success criterion. The lesson states: 'This is specification-driven development in practice.'",

        "Write the program design in plain English",
        "Install additional Python libraries and packages"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Before coding, write the design in plain English: What will the program do? What input do we need? What output should we show? This is the specification phase. Immediately typing code skips critical design thinking. Searching for code to copy defeats the learning purpose and skips design. Installing libraries is unnecessary—the capstone uses only built-in Python functions. The lesson emphasizes: 'Before you write any Python code, write your design in plain English.' This mirrors professional Spec-Driven Development.",

Not all numbers should be int—prices ($19.99) need float, phone numbers need str. Text containing digits (like '123abc') should still be str—it's not purely numeric.

It doesn't save data to files—use 'open()' and 'write()' for that (taught in later chapters). It doesn't convert types—use 'int()', 'str()', etc. for conversion.

'Price: ${price}' would only appear if you forgot the 'f' prefix—without it, {price} is literal text, not interpolation. 'price: 19.99' misses the f-string formatting.

File reading is absolutely possible in Python—it's taught in Chapter 26 (IO and File Handling). Databases are not deprecated—Python has excellent database support, taught in later parts.

Python won't crash immediately—it runs the code but the type hint is violated. 'age' is not a reserved keyword—it's a perfectly valid variable name. Integers can absolutely be assigned to variables—that's basic programming. The lesson warns about this: 'age: int = \"twenty-five\"  # Python allows this (but shouldn't)'.

      explanation: "You use 'python3' on Mac/Linux systems that have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed—'python' might point to Python 2, while 'python3' explicitly calls Python 3. Program length doesn't determine which command to use—'python' vs 'python3' is about which version is installed, not code size.
