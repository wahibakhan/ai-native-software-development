# Installing Python 3.14+ on Your Computer

Without a working Python installation, nothing else in this chapter happens. So let's get this right.

This lesson is **platform-specific**. Scroll to your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and follow those instructions. If something goes wrong, we'll show you how to troubleshoot with your AI companion.

## Why Installation Matters

You need Python installed on your computer to run Python programs. Just like you need Word installed to open .docx files, you need Python installed to run .py files.

We're specifically using **Python 3.14+** (the latest modern version). Why 3.14+ and not an older version? Because newer versions have features we use throughout Part 4. Older versions lack these features.

Installation is the bridge between "understanding Python" and "running Python code."

## Choose Your Operating System

Pick the tab below that matches your computer:

::::os-tabs

::windows
### Step 1: Download Python

Go to **[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** in your web browser.

You'll see a large yellow button that says "Download Python 3.14.x" (or whatever the latest version is). Click it.

This downloads an installer file to your computer (usually to your Downloads folder).

### Step 2: Run the Installer

Find the downloaded file (it'll be named something like `python-3.14.x-amd64.exe`) and double-click it.

An installer window opens. This is where Windows installations often go wrong, so pay attention to this:

**CRITICAL**: You'll see a checkbox that says "Add Python to PATH."

**Check this box.** This allows your terminal to find Python.

Click through the remaining screens and select "Install Now." The installer will add Python to your computer.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell). Type:

```
python --version
```

Press Enter. You should see output like:

```
Python 3.14.0
```

If it shows "Python 2.x" or a lower version, you need to reinstall. If it says "python: command not found," see "Troubleshooting" below.

### Step 4: Test with a Simple Program

Still in your terminal, type this exact command:

```
python -c "print('Hello, Python!')"
```

Press Enter. You should see:

```
Hello, Python!
```

Congratulations—Python is installed and working on Windows.

::macos
### Step 1: Download Python

Go to **[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** in your web browser.

Click the yellow "Download Python 3.14.x" button.

This downloads an installer file (usually to your Downloads folder).

### Step 2: Run the Installer

Find the downloaded file and double-click it.

A macOS installer window opens. Follow the prompts. Unlike Windows, you don't need to worry about PATH—macOS usually handles this automatically.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal). Type:

```
python3 --version
```

Press Enter. You should see:

```
Python 3.14.0
```

Note: On Mac, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python` if Python 2 is also installed. Both work—they're the same thing on modern Macs.

### Step 4: Test with a Simple Program

In your terminal, type:

```
python3 -c "print('Hello, Python!')"
```

Press Enter. You should see:

```
Hello, Python!
```

Python is now installed and working on Mac.

::linux
### Step 1: Use Your Package Manager

Linux doesn't require downloading from python.org. Your package manager can install Python.

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.14
```

**Fedora/Red Hat:**
```
sudo dnf install python3.14
```

**Homebrew (if you prefer):**
```
brew install python@3.14
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Open a terminal. Type:

```
python3 --version
```

Press Enter. You should see:

```
Python 3.14.0
```

### Step 3: Test with a Simple Program

```
python3 -c "print('Hello, Python!')"
```

Press Enter. You should see:

```
Hello, Python!
```

Python is installed on Linux.

## Troubleshooting with AI Assistance

Did something go wrong? Don't panic. This is where AI excels.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "I tried to install Python on [Windows/Mac/Linux] and got this error: [paste the full error message here]. What does this mean, and how do I fix it step-by-step?"

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, installation errors are learning opportunities. System configuration (PATH variables, permissions, OS differences) is complex—AI excels at diagnosing these platform-specific issues. Your job: provide complete error context (OS version, exact error message). AI's job: translate cryptic system errors into actionable fixes. This troubleshooting partnership is essential for professional development.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Show me 3 different ways to verify Python 3.14 is installed correctly (beyond just `python --version`). For each method, explain what it validates that the others don't. Then create a one-line Python command that prints my Python version in a formatted message like 'Python version: X.X.X'."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll learn multiple verification strategies (version check, test execution, module availability), understand why redundant validation matters in professional development, and practice using Python's `-c` flag for quick commands.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: "I installed Python 2 instead of Python 3.14"

Check your version: `python --version` should show "Python 3.14.x" or higher.

If it shows "Python 2.x", uninstall Python 2 and install Python 3.14 from python.org.

**Mistake 2**: "Python command not found" or "python: command not found"

This usually means Python isn't in your PATH (especially on Windows).

On Windows: Reinstall Python and check the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox.

On Mac/Linux: Try using `python3` instead of `python`.

If still stuck, ask your AI companion: "I get 'python: command not found' when I run `python --version`. How do I fix this?" Include your operating system.

**Mistake 3**: "I don't know if my installation is correct"

Run both these commands:

```
python --version
```

```
python -c "print('Hello')"
```

If both work and show correct output, your installation is correct. Done.

## Try With AI

How do you diagnose Python installation problems systematically?

**🔍 Explore Common Installation Errors:**
> "A Windows user installed Python from python.org but gets 'python is not recognized as an internal or external command' when running `python --version`. What's the likely cause and step-by-step solution? Explain what PATH is and why it matters."

**🧪 Test Edge Case Diagnosis:**
> "The user says they DID check 'Add Python to PATH' during installation, but the error persists. What are 2-3 other reasons this error could happen on Windows? For each, give me the diagnostic command to verify it's the problem and the fix."

**🎯 Build Troubleshooting Guide:**
> "Create a troubleshooting guide for 'python: command not found' errors on Windows covering: most common cause, how to verify PATH configuration, how to fix PATH if wrong, alternative solutions if PATH is correct, and how to test that the fix worked. Make each step clear for beginners."

**🚀 Practice Cross-Platform Debugging:**
> "A Mac user runs `python3 --version` and sees 'Python 2.7.x' instead of Python 3.14. Diagnose the problem, explain why macOS has this version conflict, and provide the solution. What's different about Python installation on Mac vs Windows?"
