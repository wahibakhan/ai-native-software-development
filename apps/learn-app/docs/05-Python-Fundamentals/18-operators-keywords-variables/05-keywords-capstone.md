# Keywords and Capstone: Building a Type-Safe Calculator

You've mastered four types of operators. Now it's time to learn one more important concept about Python's language structure: **keywords**. Keywords are reserved words that Python has claimed for itself. You can't use them as variable names because Python needs them for language features.

Then we'll bring everything together in a capstone project: a calculator that demonstrates all four operator types, combined with keyword awareness and type validation.

## What It Is: Python's Reserved Words

A **keyword** is a word that Python uses for language syntax. These words have special meaning and control how Python works. Because Python needs them for specific purposes, you can't use them as variable names.

Python has **35 keywords** (as of Python 3.14). You don't need to memorize them—you need to recognize common ones and know how to check if a word is reserved.

### Discovering Python Keywords

Python provides a simple way to see all keywords:

```python
# Import the keyword module
import keyword

# See all Python keywords
print("Python keywords:")
print(keyword.kwlist)

# Output (abbreviated):
# ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await',
#  'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except',
#  'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is',
#  'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try',
#  'while', 'with', 'yield']

# Count them
print(f"Total keywords: {len(keyword.kwlist)}")  # 35

# Check if a specific word is a keyword
print(keyword.iskeyword("for"))        # True (reserved)
print(keyword.iskeyword("forloop"))    # False (not reserved)
print(keyword.iskeyword("count"))      # False (not reserved)
```

These 35 keywords are Python's grammar. They define language structure: loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `else`), functions (`def`), classes (`class`), and more.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Why can't I use keywords as variable names? What would happen to Python's design if `if`, `for`, or `def` weren't reserved? Explain the problem and why reservation is necessary."

This question helps you understand language design—why certain words must be protected.

### Why Keywords Are Reserved

Let's see what happens when you try to use a keyword as a variable name:

```python
# WRONG: Trying to use 'for' as a variable
# for = 5  # SyntaxError: invalid syntax (for is reserved!)

# RIGHT: Use a descriptive alternative
for_loop_count: int = 5      # Underscore makes it clear
loop_count: int = 5          # Descriptive name
iterations: int = 5          # Alternative name

# Common keywords and what they do
# if, elif, else — conditional logic (Chapter 22)
# for, while — loops (Chapter 22)
# def — define functions (Chapter 25)
# class — define classes (Chapter 29)
# import, from — import modules (Chapter 25)
# return — return from function (Chapter 25)
# try, except, finally — error handling (Chapter 26)
# True, False, None — special values (Chapter 19)
# and, or, not — logical operators (Lesson 3, this chapter!)
```

The reason `for`, `if`, `def` are reserved is that Python needs them for language structure. If you could write `for = 5`, Python would get confused: "Is this the start of a for loop, or is this assigning 5 to the variable for?"

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize all 35 keywords. You develop a reflex: "If I get a SyntaxError when naming a variable, it might be a keyword. Let me check with `keyword.iskeyword()`." This defensive habit will save you debugging time.

![Diagram showing Python variable naming rules and conventions: valid identifiers must start with letter or underscore, can contain letters numbers underscores, cannot be keywords, with examples of valid and invalid names plus PEP 8 style guidelines](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-5/chapter-18/python-variable-naming-rules-conventions.png)

### Checking if a Word is Reserved

A smart programming practice is to check before using a word as a variable name:

```python
import keyword

# Function to check if a name is valid (simplified)
def is_valid_name(word: str) -> bool:
    """Check if a word is not a keyword"""
    return not keyword.iskeyword(word)

# Test it
potential_names: list[str] = ["count", "for", "result", "while", "data"]

for name in potential_names:
    if keyword.iskeyword(name):
        print(f"  '{name}' is RESERVED - use '{name}_var' instead")
    else:
        print(f"  '{name}' is OK - can use as variable name")

# Output:
# count is OK
# for is RESERVED - use for_var instead
# result is OK
# while is RESERVED - use while_var instead
# data is OK
```

This pattern—checking before using—is good defensive programming.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Create a program that:
> 1. Lists all 35 Python keywords
> 2. Groups them by category (control flow, function definition, special values, etc.)
> 3. Explains what each category does
>
> Then explain: Why do you think keywords are organized this way? What would happen if Python had no keywords?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see that keywords follow logical categories; understand that language design requires structure; appreciate why Python protects certain words.

## Capstone Project: Calculator with Type Safety

Now let's bring everything together. You'll create a calculator that demonstrates:
- **Arithmetic operators** (Lesson 1): `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
- **Comparison operators** (Lesson 2): `==`, `!=`, `>`, `&lt;`, `>=`, `&lt;=`
- **Logical operators** (Lesson 3): `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Assignment operators** (Lesson 4): `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- **Type validation**: Using `type()` to verify results
- **Keyword awareness**: Recognizing reserved words

### Simplified Calculator (Beginner-Friendly Version)

If you haven't learned functions yet, here's a straightforward version:

```python
# DEMO: Interactive calculator (requires user input)
# Capstone Project: Simple Calculator with Type Safety
# Demonstrates all 4 operator types + type validation + keyword awareness

import keyword

print("=" * 50)
print("SIMPLE CALCULATOR WITH TYPE SAFETY")
print("=" * 50)

# Input two numbers
num1: float = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2: float = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Arithmetic operators (Lesson 1)
print("--- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ---")
add_result: float = num1 + num2
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {add_result} (type: {type(add_result).__name__})")

sub_result: float = num1 - num2
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {sub_result} (type: {type(sub_result).__name__})")

mul_result: float = num1 * num2
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {mul_result} (type: {type(mul_result).__name__})")

# Comparison operators (Lesson 2)
print("--- COMPARISON OPERATORS ---")
is_equal: bool = num1 == num2
print(f"{num1} == {num2}: {is_equal} (type: {type(is_equal).__name__})")

is_greater: bool = num1 > num2
print(f"{num1} > {num2}: {is_greater} (type: {type(is_greater).__name__})")

is_less: bool = num1 < num2
print(f"{num1} < {num2}: {is_less} (type: {type(is_less).__name__})")

# Logical operators (Lesson 3)
print("--- LOGICAL OPERATORS ---")
both_positive: bool = (num1 > 0) and (num2 > 0)
print(f"Both positive: {both_positive} (type: {type(both_positive).__name__})")

either_large: bool = (num1 > 10) or (num2 > 10)
print(f"Either > 10: {either_large} (type: {type(either_large).__name__})")

not_equal_result: bool = not (num1 == num2)
print(f"Not equal: {not_equal_result} (type: {type(not_equal_result).__name__})")

# Assignment operators (Lesson 4)
print("--- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS ---")
total: float = 0.0
total += add_result
print(f"After adding result: total = {total}")

total -= 5.0
print(f"After subtracting 5: total = {total}")

total *= 0.5
print(f"After halving: total = {total} (type: {type(total).__name__})")

# Keyword awareness
print("--- KEYWORD AWARENESS ---")
test_words: list[str] = ["count", "for", "result", "if", "my_var"]
print("Checking variable names:")
for word in test_words:
    if keyword.iskeyword(word):
        print(f"  '{word}' is RESERVED - don't use as variable name")
    else:
        print(f"  '{word}' is OK - can use as variable name")

# Division with safety check
print("--- SAFE DIVISION ---")
if num2 != 0:
    div_result: float = num1 / num2
    print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {div_result} (type: {type(div_result).__name__})")
else:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

print("=" * 50)
print("Calculation complete!")
print("=" * 50)
```

**Output:**
```
==================================================
SIMPLE CALCULATOR WITH TYPE SAFETY

--- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ---
10.0 + 3.0 = 13.0 (type: float)
10.0 - 3.0 = 7.0 (type: float)

--- COMPARISON OPERATORS ---
10.0 == 3.0: False (type: bool)
10.0 > 3.0: True (type: bool)
10.0 < 3.0: False (type: bool)

  'my_var' is OK - can use as variable name

--- SAFE DIVISION ---
10.0 / 3.0 = 3.3333333333333335 (type: float)

==================================================
Calculation complete!
==================================================
```

**That's the complete calculator!** You've now integrated all four operator types (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment) plus keyword awareness and type validation—all using only the Python concepts you've learned so far (Chapters 15-15).

**What about functions?** You might wonder why the calculator code is all in one block instead of organized into functions. That's intentional! Functions are taught in Chapter 25. For now, focus on understanding how operators work together. When you reach Chapter 25, you can come back and refactor this calculator using functions as practice.

## Chapter 20 Complete

Congratulations! You've mastered all four operator types: arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment. You understand how to combine them, validate types, and recognize Python's language boundaries (keywords).

**What's Next (Chapter 21)**: Strings and text manipulation—you'll see that operators work with strings too (concatenation with `+`, repetition with `*`).

**Looking Ahead (Chapter 22)**: Control flow and loops—you'll use comparison and logical operators in `if` statements and loops, applying everything you learned here to make decisions and repeat code.

Your foundation is solid. Keep this chapter's concepts close as you move forward.
