# Assignment Operators — Updating Variables Efficiently

When you're working with variables, you often need to update them. Add 5 to a counter. Subtract a cost from a total. Multiply a score by a multiplier. You could write `count = count + 5`, but Python gives you a shorter way: `count += 5`. These are **assignment operators**—they combine an arithmetic operation with assignment in one expression.

Think of assignment operators as shortcuts. Instead of writing the long form, you write the short form. They do the same thing, just more concisely.

## What It Is: Shorthand for Updating Variables

An **assignment operator** updates a variable by combining an operation with assignment. The most common are:

- `=` **Basic assignment** — store a value (we've been using this)
- `+=` **Add and assign** — add to the current value
- `-=` **Subtract and assign** — subtract from the current value
- `*=` **Multiply and assign** — multiply the current value
- `/=` **Divide and assign** — divide the current value

All of these make code more readable and concise.

## Assignment vs. Comparison: Critical Distinction

Before we go further, let's reinforce something from Lesson 2. There are three different "equals" symbols in Python, and they mean different things:

- `=` **Assignment** — store a value in a variable
- `==` **Comparison** — ask if two values are equal
- `+=` **Assignment with operation** — add and store

Using the wrong one is a common mistake. Here's why it matters:

```python
# CORRECT: x = 5 (assignment)
x: int = 5
print(x)  # 5

# INCORRECT: if x = 5: (syntax error in if statement)
# This fails because if expects a True/False condition, not an assignment

# CORRECT: if x == 5: (comparison)
if x == 5:
    print("x is 5")  # This works!

# CORRECT: x += 5 (assignment with addition)
x += 5
print(x)  # 10
```

Assignment operators start with a symbol from Lesson 1 (arithmetic), then end with `=`. So `+=` means "add and assign," `*=` means "multiply and assign," etc.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Why does Python use three different 'equals' operators (=, ==, +=)? Why not use something like `add x 5` or `add-assign x 5` instead? Explain the design reasoning."

This helps you understand Python's philosophy about clarity and consistency in syntax.

## The Five Assignment Operators

Let's see each assignment operator with equivalent expanded forms.

### Addition and Subtraction Assignment

```python
# Addition assignment: +=
count: int = 10

# Method 1: Expanded form (long way)
count: int = count + 5
print(f"After + : {count}")  # 15

# Method 2: Shorthand (equivalent, cleaner)
count: int = 10
count += 5
print(f"After +=: {count}")  # 15 (same result)

# These two are equivalent:
# count = count + 5
# count += 5

# Subtraction assignment: -=
balance: float = 100.0

balance -= 25.0  # Subtract and assign
print(f"Balance after withdrawal: {balance}")  # 75.0

# Equivalent to: balance = balance - 25.0
```

The `+=` operator adds a value to the current value and stores the result back. `count += 5` means "take the current value of count, add 5, and store the result back in count." Same for `-=`, just with subtraction.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight

> In AI-native development, you don't worry about memorizing the difference between `count = count + 5` and `count += 5`. You use whichever feels more readable in context. Most Python developers prefer `+=` because it's concise and shows your intent clearly: "increment this variable." If you forget the syntax, ask AI: "Show me the shorthand for adding 5 to count," and move on.

### Multiplication and Division Assignment

```python
# Multiplication assignment: *=
price: float = 100.0

# Apply a 10% price increase
price *= 1.10  # Multiply and assign
print(f"New price: ${price:.2f}")  # $110.00

# Equivalent to: price = price * 1.10

# Division assignment: /=
total: float = 100.0

# Split cost equally among 4 people
total /= 4
print(f"Cost per person: ${total:.2f}")  # $25.00

# Equivalent to: total = total / 4
# Note: This returns a float, even if total was an int!
```

The `*=` operator is very useful for percentages and scaling. The `/=` operator is useful for averaging or dividing quantities. Remember: `/=` always produces a float result (same as `/` from Lesson 1).

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Write code that tracks a bank account:
> 1. Start with balance = 1000
> 2. Add a deposit: balance += 500
> 3. Subtract a withdrawal: balance -= 200
> 4. Apply interest (multiply by 1.05): balance *= 1.05
> 5. Show the final balance and its type
>
> Explain what happens to the type when you use /= on an integer variable."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see assignment operators used in realistic financial scenarios; understand type behavior (int to float when using /=); practice reading and predicting code behavior.

## Assignment Operators in Common Patterns

### The Counter Pattern

The most common use of `+=` is counting:

```python
# Pattern: Starting a counter at 0, incrementing it
count: int = 0

# Simulate processing items
items: list[str] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

for item in items:
    count += 1  # Increment by 1
    print(f"Item {count}: {item}")

print(f"Total items: {count}")  # 4
```

You'll see `count += 1` everywhere in Chapter 22 (loops). This pattern is so common it's almost universal.

### The Accumulator Pattern

Another common pattern is accumulating a total:

```python
# Pattern: Starting a total at 0, adding values to it
total: float = 0.0

# Simulate processing prices
prices: list[float] = [10.50, 20.99, 15.00]

for price in prices:
    total += price  # Add to the running total
    print(f"Running total: ${total:.2f}")

print(f"Final total: ${total:.2f}")  # $46.49
```

Again, you'll see this pattern frequently in Chapter 22.

## Type Behavior with Assignment Operators

Remember from Lesson 1 that types can change during operations. Assignment operators follow the same rules:

```python
# Integer arithmetic with +=
value: int = 5
value += 2  # Still int
print(f"value = {value}, type = {type(value)}")  # 7, <class 'int'>

# But division assignment changes to float
value: int = 10
value /= 2  # Changes to float!
print(f"value = {value}, type = {type(value)}")  # 5.0, <class 'float'>

# Mixing types in assignment
mixed: int = 5
mixed += 2.5  # int + float = float
print(f"mixed = {mixed}, type = {type(mixed)}")  # 7.5, <class 'float'>

# String concatenation (string + is supported)
greeting: str = "Hello"
greeting += " World"  # String concatenation
print(greeting)  # "Hello World"
```

Type behavior with assignment operators follows the same rules as regular operators from Lesson 1. This consistency makes it predictable.

## Try With AI

Ready to update variables efficiently with assignment operators?

**🔍 Explore Assignment Operator Mechanics:**
> "Compare regular assignment with compound operators. Show me: (1) score = score + 10 vs. score += 10—are they equivalent? (2) For +=, -=, *=, /=, //= show examples with type() checks. (3) Why does /= change int to float but //= keeps int? (4) Demonstrate that score += 5 is shorter AND faster than score = score + 5."

**🎯 Practice Score Tracking:**
> "Create a game score tracker starting at 0. Apply these events: collect 10 coins (+=), lose 3 coins (-=), double score (power-up using *=), split between 2 players (/=), round down (//=). After each operation, show: current score, type() result, and explain why the type changes or stays the same. Predict the final score before running code."

**🧪 Test Operators with Different Types:**
> "Show me assignment operators with strings: (1) Build 'Hello World!' character-by-character using += starting from empty string. (2) Use *= to repeat 'Hi' 3 times. (3) Explain why += works for both numbers and strings but -= doesn't work for strings. (4) Try score -= 'text' and show me the TypeError that occurs."

**🚀 Apply to Your State Management:**
> "I'm building [describe your application]. Help me track changing values like: account balances (deposits/withdrawals with += and -=), counters (page views with +=), multipliers (discounts with *=), or accumulated totals. For each case, show the appropriate assignment operator and explain why it's the right choice. Add type hints and validation."
