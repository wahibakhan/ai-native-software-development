  questions={[    {
      question: "When you divide two integers using `/`, what type does Python return?",
      options: [
        "Always returns float type value",
        "Always returns int type value",
        "Returns int if divisible evenly",
        "Returns based on operand types"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that `/` always returns float. Python's division operator `/` always produces a float result, even when dividing two integers (e.g., 10 / 5 gives 2.0, not 2). This is by design because division often produces decimals, so Python ensures type consistency. The option suggesting int return is incorrect because `/` never returns int—it always produces float. The option about returning int if divisible evenly is wrong—even 10 / 5 gives 2.0 (float), not 2 (int). The option about basing result on operand types is incorrect—the result is always float regardless of whether you divide int/int, float/float, or mixed types. Use `//` (floor division) if you need integer results.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the result of `10 // 3` in Python?",
      options: [
        "Raises a division error message",
        "Gives 3.33 as float value",
        "Gives 3.0 as float value",
        "Gives 3 with integer division"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is 3 (integer). Floor division `//` divides and discards the decimal part, returning only the whole number. With integers, it returns an integer type (10 // 3 = 3). The option suggesting 3.33 is incorrect because `//` doesn't preserve decimals—that's what `/` does (10 / 3 = 3.333...). The option suggesting 3.0 is wrong because floor division of two integers returns int, not float. The option about raising errors is incorrect—floor division is valid and doesn't raise errors (unlike division by zero).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does Python have both `/` and `//` division operators?",
      options: [
        "Division optimized for different hardware types",
        "Backwards compatibility with older Python versions",
        "Division needs float and integer variants",
        "Division requires two different syntax forms"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that `/` returns float and `//` returns integer results. Python provides both operators to give programmers control over result types: use `/` when you need precise decimal results (like 10 / 3 = 3.333...), and use `//` when you need whole numbers (like counting groups: 10 // 3 = 3 complete groups). The option about hardware optimization is incorrect—it's about type control, not hardware differences. The option about backwards compatibility is wrong—both operators exist in modern Python by intentional design choice. The option about syntax forms is incorrect—they serve different purposes, not just different syntax for the same operation.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What does the modulus operator `%` return for `17 % 5`?",
      options: [
        "Returns the quotient value three",
        "Returns the remainder value two",
        "Returns the division result decimal",
        "Returns the floor division result"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is 2 (the remainder). The modulus operator `%` returns what's left over after division. When you divide 17 by 5, you get 3 complete groups (15) with 2 left over, so `17 % 5 = 2`. The option about quotient is incorrect—that's what `//` returns (17 // 5 = 3). The option about division result decimal is wrong—that's what `/` returns (17 / 5 = 3.4). The option about floor division result is incorrect—floor division gives the quotient (3), not the remainder (2). Common use: checking if numbers are even (`n % 2 == 0`).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "When mixing `int` and `float` with arithmetic operators, what type results?",
      options: [
        "Result type is always float",
        "Result type matches the first",
        "Result type matches the second",
        "Result type depends on operation"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is float. When you mix int and float in arithmetic (e.g., 5 + 2.0), Python always promotes the result to float because float can represent any integer value without data loss. This is called type promotion. The options suggesting the result matches first or second operand are incorrect—order doesn't matter (5 + 2.0 and 2.0 + 5 both give 7.0). The option about depending on operation is wrong—all arithmetic operations follow this type promotion rule consistently (+, -, *, /, //, %, **).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you use the exponentiation operator `2 ** 10`?",
      options: [
        "Performs bitwise shift operation left",
        "Multiplies two by ten directly",
        "Divides two by ten repeatedly",
        "Calculates two raised to tenth"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is 1024 (2 to the 10th power). The `**` operator raises the left operand to the power of the right operand (2 ** 10 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1024). The option about multiplication is incorrect—that would be `2 * 10 = 20`, not exponentiation. The option about division is wrong—division is `/`, not `**`. The option about bitwise shift is incorrect—bitwise shift uses `&lt;&lt;` and `>>`, not `**`. Note: Don't confuse `**` with `^` (which is XOR in Python, not exponentiation).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "Why should you use parentheses even when not required by precedence?",
      options: [
        "Parentheses prevent all runtime errors",
        "Parentheses improve code execution speed",
        "Parentheses make intent absolutely clear",
        "Parentheses are required by linters"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is clarity. Parentheses make your intent explicit to anyone reading the code. While Python knows operator precedence (PEMDAS), readers might not remember or might misread. Compare `price * (1 + tax_rate)` vs. `price * 1 + tax_rate * price`—the first is instantly clear. The option about preventing runtime errors is incorrect—they clarify logic but don't prevent runtime errors like ZeroDivisionError. The option about execution speed is wrong—parentheses don't affect performance. The option about linters is incorrect—linters recommend clarity, but parentheses aren't universally required by syntax.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What type does `10 // 3.0` return in Python?",
      options: [
        "Returns integer because using floor",
        "Returns float because operand float",
        "Returns decimal as precise value",
        "Returns string representation of result"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is float. Even though `//` performs floor division (discarding decimals), if either operand is float, the result is float. So `10 // 3.0 = 3.0` (float), not `3` (int). This follows Python's type promotion rule: if any operand is float, the result is float. The option suggesting integer is incorrect—floor division doesn't guarantee int type when operands include floats. The option about decimal as precise value is wrong—floor division always discards fractional parts (3.0, not 3.333...). The option about string is absurd—arithmetic operators return numbers, not strings.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "Which scenario best demonstrates when to use floor division `//`?",
      options: [
        "Calculating average of multiple numbers",
        "Computing scientific decimal measurements precisely",
        "Finding precise financial interest rates",
        "Counting complete groups from total"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is counting complete groups. Floor division is perfect when you need whole units: 'How many groups of 3 can I make from 10 people?' (10 // 3 = 3 complete groups). The option about calculating averages is wrong—averages need precision, use `/` (sum / count = decimal result). The option about financial interest rates is incorrect—financial calculations require precision, not truncated integers. The option about scientific measurements is wrong—scientific work needs decimals (`/`), not floor division (`//`). Use `//` when fractional parts don't make sense (you can't have 0.33 of a group).",
      source: "Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What distinguishes `=` from `==` in Python?",
      options: [
        "Single equals assigns value store",
        "Single equals compares two values",
        "Single equals tests for equality",
        "Single equals declares variable type"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is assignment. `=` stores a value in a variable (`x = 5` means 'store 5 in x'), while `==` compares two values and returns True/False (`x == 5` asks 'is x equal to 5?'). Confusing them causes SyntaxError in conditionals: `if x = 5:` is invalid (should be `if x == 5:`). Option 2 is incorrect—that's what `==` does. Option 3 is wrong—that's also `==`. Option 4 is incorrect—type hints use `:` not `=` (`x: int = 5`).",
      source: "Lesson 2: Comparison Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What type does any comparison operation return in Python?",
      options: [
        "Returns string yes or no",
        "Returns integer zero or one",
        "Returns boolean True or False",
        "Returns None or value type"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is bool (True or False). All comparison operators (==, !=, >, &lt;, >=, &lt;=) return boolean values. For example, `5 > 3` returns `True`, and `5 == 10` returns `False`. You can verify with `type(5 > 3)` → `<class 'bool'>`. Option 2 is incorrect—though True equals 1 and False equals 0 in arithmetic contexts, the type is bool, not int. Option 3 is wrong—Python uses True/False, not strings. Option 4 is incorrect—comparisons always return bool, never None.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Comparison Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "Why does `5 == 5.0` return True in Python?",
      options: [
        "Python converts everything to strings",
        "Python compares values not types",
        "Python ignores decimal points always",
        "Python treats integers as floats"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is value equality. Python's `==` operator compares values, not types. Since 5 (int) and 5.0 (float) represent the same mathematical value, they're equal. You can verify: `type(5) != type(5.0)` is True (different types), but `5 == 5.0` is True (same value). Option 2 is wrong—no string conversion happens. Option 3 is incorrect—decimals matter (5.1 != 5). Option 4 is wrong—types remain distinct; only the comparison is value-based. Note: `5 == '5'` is False (different types AND values).",
      source: "Lesson 2: Comparison Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "When should you use `>=` instead of `>` in conditions?",
      options: [
        "When you want to include the boundary value",
        "When comparing floating point numbers only",
        "When checking string length comparisons exclusively",
        "When testing negative numbers for conditions"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is including the boundary. Use `>=` when the equal case should also be True. Example: checking age eligibility 'must be 18 or older' requires `age >= 18` (includes 18). If you used `age > 18`, someone who is exactly 18 would be excluded incorrectly. Option 2 is wrong—`>=` works with all numeric types. Option 3 is incorrect—`>=` works with many types, not just strings. Option 4 is wrong—`>=` behavior is the same for positive and negative numbers.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Comparison Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "What does `10 != 5` evaluate to?",
      options: [
        "Raises ValueError for inequality test",
        "Evaluates to False because different",
        "Evaluates to None for comparison",
        "Evaluates to True because different"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is True. The `!=` operator checks if values are NOT equal. Since 10 and 5 are different, `10 != 5` returns True. Think of `!=` as the opposite of `==`: if `==` would return False, `!=` returns True (and vice versa). Option 2 is backwards—different values make `!=` True. Option 3 is wrong—comparisons return bool, not None. Option 4 is incorrect—`!=` is a valid operator and doesn't raise errors for this usage.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Comparison Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "In what scenario would you use comparison operators with variables?",

        "Assigning values to multiple variables simultaneously",
        "Printing formatted strings to console output"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is age validation. Comparisons are perfect for validation: `user_age >= 18` (can vote?), `balance > purchase_price` (can afford?), `score == 100` (perfect score?). These produce True/False for decision-making. Option 2 is wrong—that's arithmetic (`total = a + b`). Option 3 is incorrect—that's assignment (`x = y = 5`). Option 4 is wrong—that's output (`print()`). Comparisons answer yes/no questions about values, preparing for control flow in Chapter 21.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Comparison Operators"
    },
    {
      question: "Why are comparison operators foundational for control flow in Chapter 21?",
      options: [
        "Functions depend on comparison syntax",
        "Loops need arithmetic operation results",
        "If statements require True or False",
        "Classes require comparison operator methods"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is if statements need bool values. When you write `if x > 5:`, the `x > 5` is a comparison that returns True or False, determining which code block executes. Mastering comparisons now (Chapter 19) makes control flow natural later (Chapter 21). Option 2 is wrong—loops use comparisons too, not just arithmetic. Option 3 is incorrect—functions don't inherently depend on comparisons. Option 4 is wrong—class design is Chapter 28, not related to basic comparisons.",

      question: "What does comparing `'5' == 5` return?",
      options: [
        "Returns False because different types",
        "Returns True because same value",
        "Returns None because incompatible comparison",
        "Raises TypeError because cannot compare"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is False. String `'5'` and integer `5` are different types representing different things: one is text, one is a number. Python's `==` doesn't coerce types here—it sees they're fundamentally different and returns False. Option 2 is wrong—value equality only works for compatible types (int and float are compatible, int and str are not). Option 3 is incorrect—it returns bool, not None. Option 4 is wrong—Python allows the comparison (doesn't raise TypeError); it just returns False.",

        "When x is greater than y value",
        "When both x and y exactly equal"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is when x equals y. If `x = 5` and `y = 5`, then `x &lt;= y` (5 is less than or EQUAL to 5: True) and `x >= y` (5 is greater than or EQUAL to 5: True) are both True. The `=` in `&lt;=` and `>=` includes the equality case. Option 2 is wrong—if x &lt; y, then `x >= y` would be False. Option 3 is incorrect—if x > y, then `x &lt;= y` would be False. Option 4 is wrong—type differences don't make both True simultaneously.",

        "No conditions need to be True"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The correct answer is both True. The `and` operator returns True ONLY if both conditions are True. Think of it as a strict requirement: `is_logged_in and is_verified` means BOTH must be True. If either is False, the whole expression is False. Option 2 describes `or` (at least one). Option 3 describes XOR (exclusive or), which Python doesn't have as a logical operator. Option 4 is nonsensical—`and` requires at least one condition to be True (actually both).",

      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is at least one True. The `or` operator returns True if either condition (or both) is True. It's False only when both are False. Example: `is_admin or is_moderator` grants access if you're either (or both). Option 2 describes `and`, not `or`. Option 3 is incorrect—`or` returns True even when both are True. Option 4 is backwards—that's when `or` returns False. Think: `or` is lenient (one is enough), `and` is strict (need both).",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The correct answer is reversal. `not` flips True to False and False to True. It's the simplest logical operator: `not True` → False, `not False` → True. Use it for negation: `not is_admin` (checks if NOT admin). Option 2 is incorrect—that's `!=` (comparison operator). Option 3 is wrong—checking None uses `is None`, not `not`. Option 4 is incorrect—type checking uses `isinstance()` or `type()`, not `not`. The `not` operator is purely for boolean reversal.",

      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "The correct answer is `(x > 5) and (x &lt; 10)`. A range check requires TWO comparisons joined with `and` because both conditions must be True: x must be greater than 5 AND less than 10. Option 2 is wrong—`or` would include values outside the range (x &lt; 5 or x > 10 means OUTSIDE range). Option 3 is incorrect—single comparison only checks one boundary. Option 4 is also incomplete.

Comparisons produce True/False, logical operators combine them. Option 2 is wrong—that's arithmetic, not logical. Option 3 is incorrect—that's assignment. Option 4 is wrong—that's output.
