  questions={[
    {
      question: "You're building an API client that processes paginated user records. Each page returns a list of users that you filter, then store filtered results. Which collection choice is most appropriate for the filtered results?",
      options: [
        "List because you need ordered mutable storage",
        "Tuple because API data shouldn't change once fetched",
        "Dictionary because you'll look up users by ID",
        "Set because you need unique users only"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "List is correct because you're building up filtered results progressively (mutability needed) and likely processing them in order (sequence access). While tuples are immutable, the filtering process requires building up results dynamically. Dictionaries would be appropriate if you needed fast lookups by ID, but the question describes sequential processing. Sets handle uniqueness but lose ordering, which pagination typically preserves. Understanding when mutability enables your workflow vs when immutability provides guarantees is crucial for data structure selection.",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens when you execute this code: `numbers = [1, 2, 3]; ref = numbers; ref.append(4); print(numbers)`?",
      options: [
        "Prints [1, 2, 3] because ref is a copy",
        "Prints [1, 2, 3, 4] because ref is an alias",
        "Raises error because lists are immutable after creation",
        "Prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 4] because append duplicates last element"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that it prints [1, 2, 3, 4] because ref is an alias (reference) to the same list object as numbers, not a copy. When you assign ref = numbers, both variables point to the same list in memory. Modifying the list through ref also affects numbers because they're the same object. Option 1 is wrong because assignment doesn't copy lists in Python—you need list() or [:] for copying. Option 3 is wrong because lists are mutable, not immutable. Option 4 is wrong because append adds one element to the end, not duplicates. This aliasing behavior is a common source of bugs when passing lists to functions.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Lists Mutability and Modification"
    },
    {
      question: "You ask AI to 'add multiple items to a list.' It generates: `items.append([1, 2, 3])`. What's the issue and what should you request?",
      options: [
        "Append is correct; no changes needed",
        "Use extend instead to add items individually",
        "Use insert method with position parameter",
        "Use plus operator to concatenate lists"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is to use extend instead. The code adds the entire list [1, 2, 3] as a single nested element, making items = [..., [1, 2, 3]]. To add multiple items individually, use extend([1, 2, 3]) which unpacks and adds each element: items = [..., 1, 2, 3]. Option 1 is wrong because append treats the list as one element (creates nesting). Option 3 (insert) requires a position and still treats [1, 2, 3] as one element. Option 4 (+ operator) works but creates a new list rather than modifying in-place, which may not match the requirement. Understanding append vs extend is critical for reviewing AI-generated list manipulation code.",
      source: "Lesson 3: Lists Mutability and Modification"
    },
    {
      question: "When would using a tuple as a dictionary key be more appropriate than using a string?",
      options: [
        "When the key represents multiple related values",
        "When you need faster lookup performance times",
        "When the dictionary will be modified frequently",
        "When the key needs to be changeable"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Tuples are ideal for multi-value keys like coordinates (x, y) or date components (year, month, day). Using ('Alice', 2025) as a key is more expressive than concatenating strings like 'Alice_2025'. Option 2 is wrong because tuples and strings have similar O(1) lookup performance as dict keys. Option 3 is irrelevant—dictionary modification frequency doesn't affect key type choice. Option 4 is wrong because dict keys must be immutable (hashable)—changeability would make tuples unsuitable as keys. This pattern appears frequently in data processing where natural keys have multiple components.",
      source: "Lesson 6: Tuples Immutable Sequences"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between `list.sort()` and `sorted(list)` in terms of return value and mutation?",
      options: [
        "sort() returns new list; sorted() returns None",
        "sort() modifies in-place returns None; sorted() returns new",
        "Both return new sorted lists without mutation",
        "Both modify original and return None"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The correct answer is that sort() modifies the list in-place and returns None, while sorted() returns a new sorted list without modifying the original. This is a critical distinction: sort() is a method (list.sort()) that mutates; sorted() is a function (sorted(list)) that creates. Option 1 reverses the behavior. Option 3 is wrong because sort() does mutate. Option 4 is wrong because sorted() doesn't mutate. This pattern—methods that mutate return None, functions that create return new objects—appears throughout Python. Understanding it prevents bugs like x = list.sort() (x becomes None, not the sorted list).",

    },
    {
      question: "You're processing a CSV with 100,000 user records. You need to look up user info by email quickly. Which structure provides O(1) lookup performance?",
      options: [
        "List of tuples with email as first element",
        "Dictionary with email as key and info as value",
        "Sorted list with binary search for performance",
        "Tuple of dictionaries with email field inside"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Dictionary with email as key provides O(1) average-case lookup—instant access regardless of size. Option 1 (list of tuples) requires O(n) linear search through all items. Option 3 (sorted list with binary search) gives O(log n), better than O(n) but still slower than O(1) for large datasets. Option 4 (tuple of dictionaries) requires O(n) iteration since you can't index by email—you'd search through the tuple sequentially. For 100,000 records, the difference is dramatic: dict lookup is nearly instant, list search could examine thousands of items. This is why dictionaries are fundamental for ID-based lookups in real applications.",
      source: "Lesson 10: Choosing the Right Structure"
    },
    {
      question: "What does this list comprehension produce: `[x ** 2 for x in range(5) if x % 2 == 0]`?",
      options: [
        "Squares of all numbers zero through four",
        "Squares of even numbers zero through four",
        "Even numbers zero through four without squaring",
        "Squares of numbers divisible by two only"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The comprehension produces [0, 4, 16]—squares of even numbers (0, 2, 4) from range(5). The if x % 2 == 0 filter selects even numbers, then x ** 2 squares each. Option 1 is wrong because the filter removes odds (1, 3). Option 3 is wrong because the expression x ** 2 does square values. Option 4 is technically correct but less precise—'even numbers' is clearer than 'divisible by two'. The key insight: comprehensions apply the filter BEFORE the expression, so you filter first (selecting evens), then transform (squaring). This pattern—filter then transform—is fundamental to data processing pipelines.",
      source: "Lesson 5: List Comprehensions"
    },
    {
      question: "You ask AI to 'create a read-only coordinate pair for use as a dict key.' It generates `coord = [10, 20]`. What should you request?",
      options: [
        "Add type hint list[int] for clarity only",
        "Change to tuple because lists aren't hashable",
        "Use dict directly with x and y keys",
        "Convert to string for dictionary key usage"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Change to tuple: coord = (10, 20). Lists can't be dict keys because they're mutable (unhashable), but tuples can because they're immutable. Attempting locations[[10, 20]] = 'Point A' raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'. Option 1 (type hint) doesn't fix the hashability issue. Option 3 (using a dict) misses the point—you want the coordinate as a key, not a value. Option 4 (string) works technically ('10,20') but loses type information and makes arithmetic operations awkward. When reviewing AI code, check that keys for dictionaries use immutable types (tuples, strings, numbers)—not mutable ones (lists, dicts).",
      source: "Lesson 6: Tuples Immutable Sequences"
    },
    {
      question: "In a function that modifies a list parameter, what happens to the original list passed to it?",
      options: [
        "Original is protected; only local copy changes",
        "Original is modified because lists pass by reference",
        "Python copies the list automatically for safety",
        "Original stays unchanged; function returns modified copy"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The original list is modified because Python passes lists by reference (technically, passes the reference by value). When you call process(my_list), the parameter refers to the same list object. Any mutations inside the function (append, remove, sort) affect the original. Option 1 is wrong—Python doesn't automatically copy. Option 3 is wrong for the same reason. Option 4 describes immutable behavior (like strings), not lists. This is a common source of bugs: passing a list to a function can modify it unexpectedly. To prevent this, explicitly pass a copy: process(my_list.copy()) or process(my_list[:]).",
      source: "Lesson 3: Lists Mutability and Modification"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the primary difference between accessing items in a sequence (list/tuple) vs a mapping (dict)?",
      options: [
        "Sequences use numeric indices; mappings use keys",
        "Sequences are faster for all operations",
        "Mappings maintain insertion order; sequences do not",
        "Sequences store unique items; mappings allow duplicates"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "Sequences use numeric indices (fruits[0], coordinates[2]); mappings use keys (user['name'], grades['Alice']). This reflects their purpose: sequences organize items by position, mappings by meaningful identifiers. Option 2 is wrong—mappings are faster for lookups (O(1) vs O(n)). Option 3 is backwards—modern dicts maintain insertion order, but that's not the primary distinction. Option 4 is wrong—sequences can have duplicate values, and dict keys are unique but values can repeat. Understanding this access pattern difference helps you choose the right structure: if you think 'give me item 5', use a sequence; if you think 'give me Alice's data', use a mapping.",
      source: "Lesson 1: Introduction to Collections"
    },
    {
      question: "Why might you choose a tuple over a list even when you don't need it as a dict key?",
      options: [
        "Tuples use less memory and process faster",
        "Tuples communicate immutability intent and prevent bugs",
        "Tuples support more built-in methods than lists",
        "Tuples allow duplicate values while lists do not"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Tuples communicate immutability intent—when you use a tuple, you're saying 'this data shouldn't change.' This prevents accidental modifications and makes code easier to reason about. For example, RGB_RED = (255, 0, 0) communicates this value is constant. Option 1 (memory/speed) has minor truth but isn't the primary reason—the performance difference is negligible for most applications. Option 3 is backwards—lists have more methods (append, extend, remove) precisely because they're mutable. Option 4 is wrong—both allow duplicates. The key insight: immutability is a feature, not a limitation. It provides guarantees that make code safer and more predictable.",
      source: "Lesson 6: Tuples Immutable Sequences"
    },
    {
      question: "What does `user.get('age', 0)` return if the 'age' key doesn't exist in the dictionary?",
      options: [
        "Returns None because key is missing",
        "Returns 0 the default value provided",
        "Raises KeyError because key not found",
        "Returns empty string for missing keys"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The .get() method returns the default value (0) when the key is missing. This is safer than user['age'], which raises KeyError for missing keys. Option 1 is wrong—.get() without a second argument returns None, but here we provided 0 as default. Option 3 describes bracket notation behavior (user['age']), not .get(). Option 4 is wrong—the return value is whatever you specify as default, not automatically a string. This pattern is critical for defensive programming: use .get(key, default) when keys might be missing, use [key] when you expect the key to exist and want an error if it doesn't.",

    {
      question: "You need to store a shopping cart where items can be added, removed, and processed in order. Which structure fits best?",
      options: [
        "List because order and mutability matter",
        "Tuple because cart contents are fixed",
        "Dictionary mapping item IDs to quantities",
        "Set because items should be unique"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "List is ideal: you add/remove items (mutability), process them in order (sequence), and likely don't need instant ID lookups. Option 2 (tuple) fails because carts change—items are added and removed. Option 3 (dict) would work if you needed fast 'does this item exist?' checks or wanted to aggregate quantities, but the question emphasizes order and modification. Option 4 (set) loses order, which matters for displaying the cart consistently. The decision framework: if you need to build up or modify a collection over time and order matters, choose a list. If order doesn't matter and you need fast lookups, choose a dict.",

      question: "What does this code output: `nums = [1, 2]; copy = nums[:]; copy.append(3); print(len(nums))`?",
      options: [
        "Prints 3 because copy is an alias",
        "Prints 2 because copy is independent slice",
        "Prints 3 because slice creates shallow copy",
        "Raises error because slice syntax is invalid"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Prints 2 because nums[:] creates a new independent list containing the same elements. Modifying copy doesn't affect nums—they're separate objects. Option 1 is wrong—slicing copies, assignment creates aliases. Option 3 is contradictory—'shallow copy' means independent for the list itself (correct), but the conclusion (len 3) is wrong. Option 4 is wrong—[:] is valid Python slice syntax for 'all elements.' This is the key difference: ref = nums creates an alias (both point to same list), copy = nums[:] creates a new list (independent). Understanding copy vs alias prevents subtle bugs when passing lists around.",

        "Each value from the dictionary",
        "Tuples of key-value pairs",
        "Indices for accessing dictionary items"
      ],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The loop variable contains each key. The default iteration for dicts is over keys: for k in my_dict iterates keys. To get values, use for v in my_dict.values(). To get both, use for k, v in my_dict.items(). Option 2 is wrong—values require .values(). Option 3 describes .items() iteration, not default. Option 4 is wrong—dicts don't have numeric indices like lists. This default behavior (iterating keys) makes sense: you can always get the value with my_dict[k], so having the key gives you access to everything. But explicitly using .keys(), .values(), or .items() makes intent clearer.",

      question: "You ask AI to 'reverse this list in place'. It generates `reversed_list = my_list.reverse()`. What's wrong?",

        "reverse() returns None; list is modified in place",
        "Should use sorted function for reversing order",
        "reverse() requires a parameter for direction"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The .reverse() method modifies the list in-place and returns None, so reversed_list becomes None, not the reversed list. The correct usage is just my_list.reverse() (no assignment), or use reversed_list = my_list[::-1] to get a reversed copy. Option 1 is wrong—there's no .reversed() method. Option 3 is wrong—sorted() sorts, doesn't reverse (though sorted(my_list, reverse=True) reverses while sorting). Option 4 is wrong—.reverse() takes no parameters. This is a common AI-generated bug: treating in-place mutation methods like functions that return values. Always check if a method returns None—that signals in-place mutation.",

        "{'a': [1, 3], 'b': [2]} with grouped values"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The comprehension produces {'a': 3, 'b': 2} because when a key appears multiple times, the last value overwrites previous ones. Dict keys must be unique—assigning to the same key replaces the value. Option 1 is wrong because Python dicts can't have duplicate keys. Option 3 is wrong—no error is raised; the duplicate key simply updates the value. Option 4 describes an accumulator pattern (which requires explicit logic), not default dict behavior. This behavior—last value wins—is important when processing data with possible duplicates. If you want to keep all values, you need explicit accumulation logic.",

      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "The 'in' operator checks dict keys in O(1) constant time (instant) but checks list values in O(n) linear time (examines each item). For a million items, dict lookup is nearly instant, list search could check all million. Option 2 is backwards—dicts are faster for membership checks. Option 3 is wrong—dicts check keys, not values (checking values requires 'in my_dict.values()'). Option 4 is wrong—the performance difference is dramatic at scale. This is why you use dicts for large collections where you frequently ask 'does this ID exist?'—the speed difference matters in production systems.",

      explanation: "Unpacking assigns name='Alice', age=25, and others becomes a list ['CS', 3.8, True] containing remaining items. The asterisk (*) collects 'the rest' into a list. Option 2 is wrong—this is valid Python 3 extended unpacking syntax. Option 3 is wrong—each variable gets its value; nothing is ignored. Option 4 is wrong—this creates variables, not tuples. This pattern is useful when processing records with variable-length data: you extract known fields, collect the rest.

If you want in-place modification, use list1.extend(list2). Option 1 overgeneralizes—Python doesn't always copy. Option 3 is wrong—+ works with lists, tuples, and strings. Option 4 is wrong—operators don't mutate, but methods like .append() do. Understanding operator vs method behavior is critical: operators create new objects (a + b), methods often mutate (a.extend(b)).

Option 2 (try-except) is best when missing keys are exceptional and you want to handle them specially. Option 3 (key in dict) is best when you need to check existence before deciding what to do. The best choice depends on context: .get() for defaults, 'in' for conditional logic, try-except for exceptional cases.

Option 1 is wrong—lists are explicitly not hashable. Option 3 is wrong—Python doesn't automatically convert types for you. Option 4 is wrong—no string conversion happens. The hashability requirement ensures keys can't change after being used—if a list key could be modified, the dictionary's internal structure would break.

Option 2 (bracket access) raises KeyError for missing fields—use this only when fields are required and you want errors. Option 3 (tuple) doesn't help—tuples are for immutability, not handling missing data. Option 4 (list comprehension) is irrelevant to dict field access.

Option 1 is close but imprecise—the issue is comparison, not reverse. Option 3 is close but sort() doesn't check types upfront; it fails when comparing. Option 4 suggests a workaround (key parameter for custom comparison) but doesn't explain the root cause. The solution: ensure all items are comparable (all ints, all strings, or use key=str to convert during comparison). Understanding type compatibility for operations prevents errors.",

      question: "What does `{**dict1, **dict2}` do when both dicts have overlapping keys?",
      options: [
        "Raises error because duplicate keys are invalid",
        "Merges with dict2 values overwriting dict1 values",
        "Creates nested dict with both values preserved",
        "Keeps only unique keys from both dictionaries"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The ** unpacking operator merges dicts, with rightmost values winning for duplicate keys. {**{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, **{'b': 3, 'c': 4}} produces {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}—dict2's 'b': 3 overwrites dict1's 'b': 2. Option 1 is wrong—no error, last value wins. Option 3 is wrong—no nesting occurs. Option 4 is wrong—all keys are kept, but duplicate keys have one value (the latest). This is useful for config merging: base_config = {...}, user_config = {...}, final = {**base_config, **user_config} applies user overrides to defaults.",
