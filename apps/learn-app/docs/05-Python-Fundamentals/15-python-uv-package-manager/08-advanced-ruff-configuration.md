# Advanced Ruff Configuration

## Why Configure Ruff? (Tier 1: Motivation)

In Lesson 8, you used Ruff's **defaults**: format with double quotes, 88-character lines, standard PEP 8 rules.

But what if your team prefers:
- Single quotes instead of double quotes?
- 100-character lines instead of 88?
- Stricter rules (docstring checking, strict naming)?
- Ignoring certain rules (e.g., E501 line length)?

**Solution**: **Configure Ruff in `pyproject.toml`** so your team all follows the same rules.

**Key benefit**: Configuration is **version-controlled** (part of your git repo). Everyone on the team gets identical settings automatically when they clone the project.

---

## The TOML Format (Tier 1: Brief Introduction)

Before configuring Ruff, you need to understand **TOML** files (the format `pyproject.toml` uses).

TOML is simple:
- `key = value` for settings
- `[section.subsection]` for grouping
- Comments with `#`

**Example pyproject.toml structure:**
```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
```

**Key insight**: You don't memorize TOML syntax. In **Tier 2**, you'll ask AI to generate configurations, and you'll just paste them in. The goal is understanding **what** to configure, not memorizing **how**.

---

## Basic Ruff Configuration (Tier 2: AI-Assisted)

Open your project's `pyproject.toml` file in Zed.

**Current structure (after `uv init`):**
```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.13"

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["ruff>=0.14.0"]
```

Now you'll add a **`[tool.ruff]` section** to customize behavior.

**Tell your AI companion:**
```
I have a Python project using uv and Ruff. My team prefers:
- 88-character line length (Ruff default)
- Python 3.13
- Import sorting enabled
- Unused import detection

Update my pyproject.toml with a [tool.ruff] section that configures this.
```

**AI will generate something like:**
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py313"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I"]

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
```

**Copy-paste this into your `pyproject.toml`.**

**Verify it works:**
```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

Ruff now uses your custom configuration.

## Rule Categories Explained (Tier 1: Understand Options)

Ruff organizes rules into **categories** (single letters). You enable/disable whole categories:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **E** | **pycodestyle** — PEP 8 style | Spacing, indentation, blank lines |
| **F** | **Pyflakes** — Logic errors | Unused imports, undefined variables |
| **B** | **flake8-bugbear** — Likely bugs | Mutable defaults, unreachable code |
| **I** | **isort** — Import sorting | Alphabetize imports, group them |
| **N** | **pep8-naming** — Naming rules | Function names in lowercase |
| **D** | **pydocstyle** — Docstrings | Docstring formatting (advanced) |

**Example: Select import sorting + bug detection:**
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["F", "I", "B"]  # Pyflakes, isort, bugbear
```

**Example: Select all but ignore long lines:**
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F"]       # pycodestyle + Pyflakes
ignore = ["E501"]         # But ignore line-too-long
```

**Key insight**: Start simple (select F for safety), add more rules as your team agrees.

---

## Configure Line Length & Target Version (Tier 1: Common Settings)

Every project needs these two settings:

### **line-length**
How many characters wide should a line be before Ruff complains?

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88  # Industry standard (Black-compatible)
```

**Common values:**
- `88`: Industry default (Black's choice)
- `100`: Slightly more lenient
- `120`: Very permissive
- `79`: Strict (PEP 8 original, rarely used anymore)

### **target-version**
Which Python version should Ruff assume?

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py313"  # Python 3.13
```

**Why it matters**: Ruff adjusts rules based on Python version. Python 3.13 has features older versions don't.

**Common values:**
- `"py313"`: Python 3.13 (latest, what we use)
- `"py312"`: Python 3.12
- `"py311"`: Python 3.11

---

## Complete Configuration Example (Tier 2: Reference)

Here's a **professional pyproject.toml** with complete Ruff setup:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Brief description"
authors = [{name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com"}]
requires-python = ">=3.13"

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["ruff>=0.14.0", "pyright>=1.1.400"]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py313"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "B", "I"]  # Enable: style, safety, bugs, imports
ignore = ["E501"]              # But don't complain about line length

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"         # Use "hello" not 'hello'
indent-style = "space"         # Use spaces, not tabs
```

**Save this to `pyproject.toml` and run:**
```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

Ruff now follows your configuration.

## Integrate with Zed: Format-on-Save (Tier 2: Editor Integration)

Wouldn't it be nice if **Zed automatically formatted your code when you save?**

Open Zed's settings:
- Mac: `Cmd+,` (comma)
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+,`

In the settings file, add this **Python-specific section**:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "Python": {
      "formatter": "language_server",
      "format_on_save": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Now when you save a Python file** (Cmd+S or Ctrl+S), Ruff automatically formats it.

**Benefit**: You write code freely; Ruff keeps it clean. No manual `uv run ruff format .` needed.

## Ignoring Rules Selectively (Tier 2: Fine-Tuning)

Sometimes a specific rule doesn't fit your project. You can **ignore it for a single line or the whole file.**

**Ignore one rule on a specific line:**
```python
x = 1  # noqa: F841  <- Line not used; ignore F841 error
```

**Ignore all rules for a line:**
```python
import everything_we_need  # noqa
```

**Ignore a rule project-wide:**
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = ["E501", "D100"]  # Ignore: line-too-long, missing module docstring
```

**When to use:**
- One-off exceptions: `# noqa` on the line
- Team decision: Add to `ignore` list in `pyproject.toml`

---

## Tier 3 Preview: Scaling Configuration (Tier 2: Awareness)

As projects grow, you might want:
- **Shared configuration**: One `pyproject.toml` template for all team projects
- **CI/CD integration**: Ruff checks run automatically on every git push
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Ruff runs before allowing commits

These are **Lesson 12 topics**. For now, just know: your `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for your team's code standards.

## Try With AI

How do you configure Ruff for team standards and integrate multiple quality tools without conflicts?

**🔍 Explore Configuration Hierarchy:**
> "My Python codebase has mixed styles: some files use 88-char lines, others 120; imports aren't sorted consistently; mix of single and double quotes; varying blank lines before functions. Which should I enforce via Ruff config vs leave flexible? Explain the difference between `[tool.ruff]`, `[tool.ruff.lint]`, and `[tool.ruff.format]` sections. How do I choose which rule categories (E, F, B, I, N, D) to enable? Can I have different rules for tests vs production?"

**🧪 Test Tool Conflicts:**
> "I'm using Ruff, Pyright, and Black together and hitting conflicts: Ruff and Black disagree on line breaking, Pyright catches type errors Ruff doesn't, and Zed's format-on-save sometimes formats twice or not at all. For each conflict, show me the pyproject.toml config to prevent it, explain which tool takes precedence, how to verify they work together, and the proper execution order (format → lint → type-check)."

**🎯 Build Production Configuration:**
> "Generate a production-ready `pyproject.toml` integrating Ruff (line length 88, Python 3.13 target, enable E/F/B/I categories, ignore E501, double quotes, space indentation) and Pyright (basic mode, exclude .venv and __pycache__). Ensure no conflicts, configure for Zed LSP integration, and add comments explaining each setting. For each, explain why this value (industry standard, team preference, safety) and how to test it works."

**🚀 Configure IDE Integration:**
> "Create matching Zed `settings.json` that uses Ruff for formatting with format-on-save enabled, shows Ruff diagnostics and Pyright type errors inline, excludes .venv from file watching, and sets Python tab width to 4 spaces. Include both user-level settings (all projects) and workspace settings (project-specific)."

**🔧 Troubleshoot Common Issues:**
> "I'm seeing these problems with my Ruff setup: (1) Ruff says my pyproject.toml has a syntax error, (2) Format-on-save isn't working in Zed, (3) My rules look right but Ruff still complains. For each issue, explain what's happening and give me the fix or workaround. What are the most common configuration mistakes and how can I prevent them?"
