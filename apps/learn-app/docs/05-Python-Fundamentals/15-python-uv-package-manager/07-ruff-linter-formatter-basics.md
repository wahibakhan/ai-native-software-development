# Ruff Linter & Formatter Basics

## The Too-Many-Tools Problem

Before **Ruff**, Python developers needed three separate tools to write clean code:

| Tool | Job | Problem |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Black** | Format code style | Opinionated; no configuration |
| **isort** | Sort imports alphabetically | Does only one thing |
| **Flake8** | Find code errors and style violations | Slow |

A beginner would ask: "Which tool do I use?" Answer: "All three, in that order."

**Ruff solves this: One tool does the job of all three—and runs 10–100x faster.**

---

## What Ruff Does: Format + Lint (Tier 1: Understand)

Ruff has two jobs:

### **1. Formatting** — Make code look consistent
- Fix spacing: `x=1` becomes `x = 1`
- Fix quotes: `'hello'` becomes `"hello"` (configurable)
- Add blank lines between functions
- Proper indentation

**Result**: Your code looks professional, follows Python conventions (PEP 8)

### **2. Linting** — Find likely bugs and style problems
- Unused imports: `import os` (never used)
- Unused variables: `x = 5` (assigned but never read)
- Potential bugs: `if x = 5:` (assignment instead of comparison)
- Line too long: 120+ characters on one line

**Result**: You catch problems before they cause issues

---

## Installing Ruff (Tier 1: Direct Command)

You already have `uv`. Installing Ruff is one command:

```bash
uv add ruff --dev
```

The `--dev` flag means Ruff is a **development dependency**—you need it while coding, but not when your program runs in production.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
uv run ruff --version
```

**Expected output:** `ruff 0.14.5` (or similar version number)

---

## Formatting Your Code (Tier 1: Direct Command)

Let's create a messy Python file and watch Ruff fix it.

**Create a file `messy.py`:**
```python
print('hello')
def   foo(   x,y,z   ):
    return x+y+z
```

**Observe the mess:**
- Extra spaces around `def` and function parameters
- Inconsistent quotes (`'hello'` is single-quoted)
- No spaces around operators (`x+y+z`)

**Run Ruff formatter:**
```bash
uv run ruff format messy.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
1 file reformatted
```

**Look at your file now:**
```python
print("hello")


def foo(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z
```

**What changed:**
- Single quotes → double quotes
- Extra spaces removed
- Operators have spaces: `x + y + z`
- Two blank lines before function definition (PEP 8 standard)

**Note**: This code demonstrates Ruff's formatting, not Python programming. You'll learn Python functions in Chapter 18.

---

## Checking for Errors (Linting) (Tier 1: Direct Command)

Formatting makes code look good. **Linting finds actual bugs.**

**Create a file `buggy.py`:**
```python
import os
import sys

print("Hello")
```

**The problems:**
- You imported `os` but never used it
- You imported `sys` but never used it

**Run Ruff linter:**
```bash
uv run ruff check buggy.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
F401 [*] `sys` imported but unused

Found 2 errors.
[*] 2 fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

**Read the output:**
- `F401`: Ruff code for "unused import"
- `[*]`: Means Ruff can auto-fix this error
- "2 fixable": Both errors can be automatically removed

---

## Auto-Fixing Errors (Tier 1: Direct Command)

You don't have to manually fix linting errors—Ruff can do it:

```bash
uv run ruff check buggy.py --fix
```

**Expected output:**
```
Fixed 2 errors.
```

**Check your file:**
```python
print("Hello")
```

**The unused imports are gone!** Ruff removed them automatically.

---

## Ruff Error Codes (Tier 1: Know What They Mean)

Ruff uses short codes to identify problem types:

| Code | Meaning | Fixable? |
|------|---------|----------|
| **F401** | Import not used | Yes |
| **E501** | Line too long | No (just warns) |
| **E225** | Missing whitespace around operator | Yes |
| **F841** | Variable assigned but not used | Yes |
| **E203** | Whitespace before colon | Yes |

**Key insight**: You don't memorize these codes. If you see an error, ask AI: "What does F401 mean and how do I fix it?"

## When to Format, When to Lint (Tier 1: Decision-Making)

**Format when:**
- You're done writing a section of code
- Before committing to git
- Every time you save (Zed can do this automatically, Chapter 8)

**Lint when:**
- You finish a function or module
- Before running tests
- As part of your review process

**Best practice**: Run both:
```bash
uv run ruff format .          # Fix all style issues
uv run ruff check .           # Find remaining problems
```

---

## Configuration: Where Rules Live (Tier 2: Preview)

Ruff reads configuration from **`pyproject.toml`** in your project root.

You haven't configured anything yet (Ruff works with defaults). But in **Lesson 9**, you'll customize which rules to enable/disable.

For now, just know:
- Default Ruff rules are sensible (follow PEP 8, catch common bugs)
- You'll configure specific rules when you need non-defaults

## Try With AI

What's the difference between linting and formatting, and when should you ignore Ruff warnings?

**🔍 Explore Linting vs Formatting:**
> "I ran Ruff on messy Python code with unused imports, inconsistent spacing, and mixed quotes. The output shows error codes like F401, E501 with [*] markers for some. Explain the difference between formatting and linting, what the error code letters mean (F, E, W, I, N), how Ruff knows which errors are auto-fixable, and the difference between `ruff format` vs `ruff check`."

**🧪 Test False Positive Handling:**
> "Ruff is flagging three scenarios I think are legitimate: a 120-character URL string (E501 line too long), a logging import only used in exception handlers (F401 unused), and intentional mixed quotes for SQL vs Python strings. For each, is it a false positive or valid warning? Show me how to ignore specific rules per-line with `# noqa` and how to configure project-wide exceptions in pyproject.toml. When should I ignore vs fix?"

**🎯 Practice Code Quality Workflow:**
> "Create a Ruff workflow for UV projects covering: daily development (when to run format vs check, fixing incrementally, handling disagreements), pre-commit quality gates (command sequence, verification, unfixable errors), and team standards (which error categories to enable, which to ignore for learning projects, using # noqa for exceptions). Include exact commands and expected outputs."

**🚀 Integrate with Zed IDE:**
> "Show me how to set up Ruff in Zed IDE: run formatting automatically on file save, display Ruff errors inline in the editor instead of just terminal, and use quick-fix commands for auto-fixable errors. What's the optimal workflow—fix in editor or terminal?"
