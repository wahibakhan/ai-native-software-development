# Running Python Code in UV Projects with AI

## Why Environment Isolation Matters

Before you run any Python code in a UV project, you need to understand one critical concept: **environment isolation**.

Imagine you're working on two different projects:
- **Project A**: Needs `requests` version 2.28 to work correctly
- **Project B**: Needs `requests` version 2.31 for some new features

If you installed packages globally (the old way), installing version 2.31 for Project B would break Project A. This is called the **"dependency conflict" problem**, and it's one of the main reasons virtual environments exist.

**UV solves this with automatic environment isolation:**
- Each UV project gets its own separate "toolbox" of packages
- Project A's packages don't affect Project B
- You can have different versions of the same library in different projects
- No conflicts, no "works on my machine but not on yours" problems

The command `uv run` is what activates this isolation automatically. When you type `uv run python script.py`, UV:
1. Checks if the project has a virtual environment set up
2. Activates that environment (without you typing activation commands)
3. Runs your script in that isolated environment
4. Everything just works

This is the core difference between `uv run python` and just typing `python` at your terminal.

## The Difference: `uv run` vs. System Python

Let's see this in action.

**Scenario**: You have a project with the `requests` library installed via UV. Your system doesn't have `requests` installed globally.

### Without `uv run` (fails):

```bash
python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
```

**Result:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

Why? You're using system Python, which doesn't have your project's packages.

### With `uv run` (works):

```bash
# This uses UV's project environment instead of system Python
uv run python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
```

**Output:**
```
2.31.0
```

**What happened:**
- `uv run` activated your project's isolated environment
- Python accessed the `requests` library from that environment
- **No manual activation needed**—UV handles everything

## Running Scripts in Your Project

Now let's run actual Python scripts stored in your project.

### Scenario 1: Running a Simple Script

You have a file called `main.py` in your project that uses the `requests` library.

**main.py:**
```python
import requests

# Fetch data from a public API
response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Title: {response.json()['title']}")
```

**Run it:**
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Status: 200
Title: sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit
```

**What happened:**
1. `uv run` activated your project environment
2. Python executed `main.py`
3. The `requests` library was available (from your project, not system)
4. The API call succeeded and printed results


## Running Tests with Pytest

First, ensure pytest is installed (from Lesson 4):

```bash
uv add --dev pytest
```

Create a test file `test_math.py`:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

def test_add() -> None:
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest test_math.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

**Expected Output:**
```
test_math.py::test_add PASSED                                      [100%]
1 passed in 0.03s
```

## Environment Isolation in Action: Side-by-Side Comparison

Let's make the isolation concept crystal clear with a concrete example.

**Project A** (`web-client/`):
```bash
cd web-client
uv add requests==2.28.0
uv run python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
# Output: 2.28.0
```

**Project B** (`data-processor/`):
```bash
cd ../data-processor
uv add requests==2.31.0
uv run python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
# Output: 2.31.0
```

**Back to Project A:**
```bash
cd ../web-client
uv run python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
# Output: 2.28.0 (unchanged - Project A's version still safe)
```

**Without UV** (old approach):
```bash
pip install requests==2.28.0  # Install globally
pip install requests==2.31.0  # Overwrites global version!
python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
# Output: 2.31.0 (Project A breaks because global version changed)
```

This is why environment isolation is non-negotiable in professional development.

## Common Execution Errors

### Error 1: ModuleNotFoundError

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add the missing package
uv add requests

# Run your script again
uv run python your_script.py
```

### Error 2: Permission Denied (Mac/Linux)

```
bash: ./my_script.py: Permission denied
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Don't run scripts directly - use uv run
# ❌ This fails: ./my_script.py
# ✅ This works:
uv run python my_script.py
```

**When to use AI:** For complex errors or debugging test failures, ask your AI tool to analyze the error message and suggest solutions.

## Running Web Servers (Optional)

You can use `uv run` to start web servers with hot reload:

```bash
# Add web framework
uv add fastapi uvicorn

# Start development server with auto-reload
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The `--reload` flag restarts the server automatically when you save code changes—useful for development, but don't use in production.


## Key Takeaways (For Your Mental Model)

1. **`uv run` is magic** — It activates your project environment automatically. No manual activation commands needed.

2. **Isolation prevents conflicts** — Each project has its own package versions. Changing one project doesn't break another.

3. **AI is your execution partner** — Tell your AI tool what you want to run; it provides the command. You focus on understanding, not syntax.

4. **Scripts, tests, servers—same pattern** — Whether running `main.py`, `pytest`, or `uvicorn`, the pattern is the same: `uv run <command>`

5. **Errors are learning opportunities** — ModuleNotFoundError, version mismatches, permission issues—all are solvable with AI guidance.

6. **Environment isolation is non-negotiable** — Professional Python development requires it. UV makes it invisible and automatic.

## Try With AI

What does `uv run` do differently than bare `python`, and how do multiple projects coexist with different package versions?

**🔍 Explore Environment Activation:**
> "Compare running `python main.py` vs `uv run python main.py` in my UV project. What does `uv run` do that bare `python` doesn't? Where does `uv run` find installed packages? Show me the difference between `which python` and what `uv run` uses. Can I manually activate like the old `source .venv/bin/activate`?"

**🧪 Test Multi-Project Isolation:**
> "I have two UV projects: Project A needs requests 2.28.0, Project B needs requests 2.31.0. Prove they coexist without conflict by showing the version in each project. What happens if I run `python -c 'import requests'` without `uv run` in both directories—same version or different? Explain how `.venv/` enables this isolation."

**🎯 Practice Test Execution:**
> "Help me set up pytest testing. I have `test_math.py` with a failing test showing `AssertionError: assert 4.0 == 4`. Walk me through adding pytest as a dev dependency, running tests, running specific tests with verbose output, and fixing this float comparison issue. Should I use `pytest.approx()` or change the assertion?"

**🚀 Build CI/CD Testing Workflow:**
> "Create a testing workflow for UV projects covering local development and CI/CD. For local: adding pytest, running all tests, debugging failures, checking coverage with pytest-cov. For CI/CD: show me a GitHub Actions workflow file that uses `uv sync` and `uv run pytest` to run the same tests automatically."
