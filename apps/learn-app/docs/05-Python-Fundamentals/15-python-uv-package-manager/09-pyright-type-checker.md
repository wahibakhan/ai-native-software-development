# Pyright Type Checker

## Why Type Checking? (Tier 1: Motivation)

Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you can write:

```python
x = "hello"
x = 42
x = [1, 2, 3]
```

Same variable, three different types. Python doesn't complain—it just changes.

**But this causes bugs:**
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"

result = greet(42)  # Oops! Passing a number instead of a string
```

Python runs this fine until you expect `result` to be a string:
```python
upper = result.upper()  # Crash: int has no method .upper()
```

**Problem**: The bug is in `greet(42)` call, but the crash is at `.upper()`. You waste time debugging the wrong place.

**Solution**: **Type hints** tell Python what types to expect:
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"

result = greet(42)  # Type checker: ERROR! 42 is not a str
```

Now the error is **caught immediately**, before running code.

**Benefit**: Catch 30–50% of bugs statically (without running code). That's huge.

## What Are Type Hints? (Tier 1: Learn Syntax)

Type hints are **annotations** that tell Python what types variables/functions expect.

### **Function Parameter Types**

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers and return the result."""
    return x + y
```

Read as:
- `x: int` — Parameter `x` should be an integer
- `y: int` — Parameter `y` should be an integer
- `-> int` — Function returns an integer

### **Python 3.13+ Modern Syntax**

Python 3.13 introduced **new syntax** for optional types using `|` instead of `Union`:

```python
def process(data: str | None) -> int:
    """Accept string or None, return integer."""
    if data is None:
        return 0
    return len(data)
```

Read as:
- `data: str | None` — Accept string or None (called "union type")
- `-> int` — Returns an integer

**Older syntax** (Python 3.9-3.12) used `Union[str, None]`. We use 3.13+ syntax because it's cleaner.

**Note**: Type hints are **optional syntax**. Python still runs without them. They're for tools like Pyright to catch errors.

## Installing Pyright (Tier 1: Direct Command)

Just like Ruff, install via `uv`:

```bash
uv add pyright --dev
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
uv run pyright --version
```

**Expected output:** `pyright 1.1.407` (or similar version)

---

## Running Pyright (Tier 1: Direct Command)

Let's catch a type error!

**Create a file `types.py`:**
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"

result = greet(42)  # ERROR: 42 is not a str
```

**Run Pyright:**
```bash
uv run pyright types.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
/path/to/types.py:4:21 - error: Argument of type "Literal[42]" cannot be assigned to parameter "name" of type "str" in function "greet"
  "Literal[42]" is not assignable to "str"
1 error, 0 warnings
```

**Read the error:**
- Line 4, column 21: The error location
- `"Literal[42]"` cannot be assigned to `"str"`: You passed an integer where a string was expected
- `1 error`: Pyright found one type problem

**Fix the code:**
```python
result = greet("Alice")  # Correct: pass a string
```

**Run Pyright again:**
```bash
uv run pyright types.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 informations
```

Success! No type errors.

**Note**: This code demonstrates type checking, not Python programming. You'll learn more about functions and types in Chapter 18.

## Type Checking Modes (Tier 1: Understand Options)

Pyright has **four modes** controlling how strict type checking is:

| Mode | Strictness | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **off** | No checking | Legacy code (not recommended) |
| **basic** | Standard checking | Most projects (default) |
| **standard** | Stricter checking | Type-aware projects |
| **strict** | Maximum safety | Type-first projects |

**Basic mode** (default) is usually right. **Strict mode** catches more potential issues but requires more type hints.

**Configure in `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[tool.pyright]
typeCheckingMode = "standard"  # Change to "strict" for more checking
pythonVersion = "3.13"
```

---

## Common Type Errors (Tier 1: Learn Patterns)

Here are errors Pyright catches:

### **Error 1: Type Mismatch**
```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

result = add("5", "10")  # ERROR: strings are not ints
```

### **Error 2: Return Type Wrong**
```python
def get_count() -> int:
    return "five"  # ERROR: returns str, not int
```

### **Error 3: Optional Handling**
```python
def process(data: str | None) -> int:
    return len(data)  # ERROR: data might be None; len(None) crashes
```

Fix by checking for None:
```python
def process(data: str | None) -> int:
    return len(data) if data else 0
```

## Tier 2: Configure Pyright in pyproject.toml

Tell your AI:

```
I want to configure Pyright for my Python project.
I want:
- Standard type checking (not too strict)
- Python 3.13
- Report missing imports as errors
- Report unknown variable types as warnings

Generate the [tool.pyright] section for pyproject.toml.
```

AI generates:
```toml
[tool.pyright]
typeCheckingMode = "standard"
pythonVersion = "3.13"
reportMissingImports = "error"
reportUnknownVariableType = "warning"
```

Copy-paste into your `pyproject.toml` and run:
```bash
uv run pyright
```

Pyright now uses your configuration.

## Pyright + Zed Integration (Tier 2: Editor Display)

You'll configure Zed to show **Pyright type errors inline** (next lesson, Lesson 11).

For now, just know: Pyright can run in your editor, showing errors as you type—no need to open terminal.

---

## Type Hints vs. Tests (Tier 1: Understand Relationship)

**Type hints and tests are complementary:**

| Tool | Catches | Doesn't Catch |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Pyright** (type checking) | Type mismatches | Logic errors, runtime failures |
| **Tests** | Logic errors, edge cases | Type mismatches (without hints) |
| **Together** | Most bugs | Edge cases you didn't think of |

**Good practice**: Use both.

## Try With AI

Build a complete type-safe Python project integrating UV, Pyright, Ruff, and pytest.

**🔍 Explore Type-Safe Project Setup:**
> "Help me build a type-safe calculator project. Create a UV project `calc-app`, add Pyright and Ruff as dev dependencies, configure Pyright for Python 3.13 standard mode. Then create `calc.py` with functions `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` using Python 3.13+ type hints. For `divide`, handle division by zero by returning `None` if divisor is zero. Show me complete setup commands and code."

**🧪 Test Type Error Detection:**
> "Create `test_errors.py` that intentionally breaks type safety: import `add` from `calc.py` and call it with `add("5", "10")` (strings), `add(5, None)` (None), and store `divide(10, 0)` result then try math with it (might be None). For each error, show me the exact Pyright message, explain why it caught it, and propose a fix without changing type hints. What's the difference between type errors Pyright catches vs runtime errors that crash?"

**🎯 Add Production Dependencies:**
> "Make the calculator interactive using the `rich` library for terminal output. Add `rich` as production dependency (why production not dev?), create `main.py` with type hints using `rich.console.Console` to display results, accept user input for two numbers and operation (+/-/*/÷), and handle invalid input gracefully. Show how type hints guide error handling. Then add type-safe validation for when users enter text instead of numbers, handling ValueError."

**🚀 Configure Complete Toolchain:**
> "Set up full toolchain in `pyproject.toml`: Ruff (line length 88, format on save), Pyright (standard mode, Python 3.13, report missing hints as warnings not errors), and pytest as dev dependency with one test for `add()` function using type hints. Show me the commands: `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run pyright`, `uv run pytest`. All should pass. Then create a teammate onboarding checklist with environment sync, dependency install, and verification steps."

**🔧 Troubleshoot Type Checking Issues:**
> "I'm seeing these problems with Pyright: (1) Pyright says type error but my code runs fine, (2) Pyright says `str | None` is invalid syntax, (3) Pyright shows 'LSP not connected' in Zed. For each issue, explain what's happening and give me the fix or workaround. How do I know if a type error is critical or just a warning I can safely ignore?"
