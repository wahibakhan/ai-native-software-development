      options: [
        "Implementer—you must write the actual code",
        "Director—you specify intent and let the agent handle tactical decisions",
        "Observer—you watch the agent work with minimal input",
        "Administrator—you manage security and deployment configurations"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "When using General Agents, you're the Director: you specify intent clearly, let the agent handle tactical decisions, evaluate quality, and provide feedback to redirect when needed.",

        "SDLC becomes irrelevant because AI manages all phases autonomously"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Every SDLC phase is transformed but not eliminated. The emphasis shifts: humans handle specification, architecture, and validation (judgment work) while AI handles implementation (mechanical work).",

      ],
      correctOption: 1,

        "A traditional software development methodology that predates AI systems"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Spec-Driven Development is specification-first: write clear specs, then tests that encode the spec, then implement to pass tests. This discipline becomes MORE critical with AI—it amplifies good habits and bad habits alike.",

    },
    {
      question: "Why does 'AI amplifies your habits' matter for development methodology? (Lesson 9)",

        "AI eliminates the need for any development methodology"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "AI generates code instantly but won't write specs you didn't ask for or tests you didn't request. Vibe Coding + AI = Amplified Chaos. Spec-Driven + AI = Amplified Excellence. The discipline becomes more critical, not less.",
