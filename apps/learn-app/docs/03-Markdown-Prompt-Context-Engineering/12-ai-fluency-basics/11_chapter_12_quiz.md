        "Define, Document, Demonstrate, Deliver",
        "Draft, Discuss, Decide, Deliver"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The 4D Framework represents the complete workflow for AI Fluency: deciding what AI should do (Delegation), communicating intent (Description), evaluating outputs (Discernment), and ensuring responsible use (Diligence).",
      source: "Lesson 1: What is AI Fluency?"
    },
    {
      question: "Which 'D' addresses the question 'Should AI handle this task?'",
      options: [
        "Description",
        "Discernment",
        "Delegation",
        "Diligence"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Delegation is about deciding what AI should do—and what it shouldn't. It involves assessing whether a task is appropriate for AI collaboration.",
      source: "Lesson 1: What is AI Fluency?"
    },
    {
      question: "What distinguishes AI Fluency from basic 'prompt engineering'?",

        "There is no difference"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Prompt engineering is just one part of AI Fluency (Description). AI Fluency encompasses the entire collaboration: deciding what to delegate, how to describe it, how to evaluate outputs, and how to be responsible about results.",
