# Chapter 46: TDD for Agents

**Part 6: AI Native Software Development — Phase 4: Quality Assurance**

Test your agent code with confidence. This chapter teaches Test-Driven Development (TDD) for AI agent applications—testing **code correctness** (deterministic, passes/fails), not LLM reasoning quality (that's Chapter 47: Evals).

## What You'll Build

By the end of this chapter, you'll own a production-ready `agent-tdd` skill and a comprehensive test suite for your Task API with:

- **80%+ code coverage** on your agent API
- **Zero LLM API calls** during test execution
- **Sub-10-second test runs** with mocked dependencies
- **CI/CD automation** via GitHub Actions

## The Critical Distinction

| Aspect | TDD (This Chapter) | Evals (Chapter 47) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Question | Does the code work correctly? | Does the LLM reason well? |
| Nature | Deterministic | Probabilistic |
| Output | Pass/Fail | Scores (0-1) |
| Speed | Fast (mocked LLM) | Slow (real LLM calls) |
| Cost | Zero (no API calls) | High (API calls required) |

## Skill-First Learning

This chapter follows the **Skill-First pattern**:

1. **L00**: Build your `agent-tdd` skill from official documentation
2. **L01-L07**: Learn patterns that improve your skill
3. **L08**: Compose everything into a production test suite

Every lesson ends with "Reflect on Your Skill"—you'll continuously test and improve the skill you own.

## Chapter Structure

| Lesson | Title | Layer | Duration |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| L00 | Build Your Testing Skill | L1 (Manual) | 15 min |
| L01 | TDD Philosophy for Agents | L1 (Manual) | 20 min |
| L02 | pytest Fundamentals for Async Code | L1 (Manual) | 25 min |
| L03 | Testing FastAPI Endpoints | L2 (Collaboration) | 30 min |
| L04 | Testing SQLModel Operations | L2 (Collaboration) | 25 min |
| L05 | Mocking LLM Calls | L2 (Collaboration) | 30 min |
| L06 | Testing Agent Tools | L2/L3 (Transition) | 25 min |
| L07 | Integration Test Patterns | L3 (Intelligence) | 30 min |
| L08 | Capstone: Full Test Suite | L4 (Spec-Driven) | 35 min |

**Total Duration**: ~4 hours

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- **Chapter 40**: FastAPI for Agents (Task API codebase)
- **Part 5**: Python fundamentals (basic pytest knowledge)
- **Ch34-36**: Agent SDK patterns (code to test)

## What You'll Own

By completing this chapter, you'll have:

1. **`agent-tdd` skill** — A reusable testing skill built from official pytest-asyncio and respx documentation
2. **Complete test suite** — Unit, integration, and agent pipeline tests for Task API
3. **CI/CD workflow** — GitHub Actions configuration for automated testing
4. **Testing patterns** — Transferable patterns for any FastAPI + SQLModel project

## Key Technologies

- **pytest-asyncio** — Async test execution
- **httpx** — Async HTTP client with ASGITransport
- **respx** — HTTP mocking for LLM API calls
- **pytest-cov** — Coverage reporting

## Start Learning

Begin with [Lesson 0: Build Your Testing Skill](./00-build-your-testing-skill.md) to create your `agent-tdd` skill before learning the content.
