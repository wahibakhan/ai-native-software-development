# The Two Evaluation Axes

You've built an agent that summarizes customer support tickets. How do you know if it's doing a good job?

Your first instinct might be to run some test cases and see if the outputs "look right." But "looks right" doesn't scale. You need systematic evaluation—and here's the problem: **not all evals work the same way**.

Some agent behaviors have clear right answers you can check with code. Others require judgment calls that only a human (or another AI) can make. Some behaviors have reference outputs you can compare against. Others have no single "correct" answer—just better and worse ones.

Understanding these distinctions changes how you design evaluations. The wrong approach gives you unreliable scores. The right approach gives you actionable signal about agent quality.

## Two Questions That Define Every Eval

Every evaluation you'll ever write falls somewhere on two independent axes:

**Axis 1: How do you check correctness?**
- **Objective (Code-checkable)**: A deterministic function can verify correctness
- **Subjective (LLM-judged)**: Requires reasoning about quality, not just matching

**Axis 2: Do you have ground truth?**
- **Per-example ground truth**: Each test case has a known "correct" answer
- **No per-example ground truth**: Quality is assessed against criteria, not reference outputs

These two axes create four distinct quadrants—each requiring different evaluation strategies.

## Axis 1: Objective vs Subjective Scoring

### Objective Evals (Code Can Check)

Objective evaluations use deterministic functions to verify correctness. The grader runs code that returns pass/fail or a numeric score—no AI reasoning required.

**Characteristics**:
- Same input always produces same evaluation result
- Implemented as pure functions (Python, regex, parsers)
- Fast and cheap to run (no LLM API calls for grading)
- Zero ambiguity—the code decides

**Examples of objective criteria**:

| Criterion | How Code Checks It |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Response under 500 tokens | `len(tokenize(response)) &lt; 500` |
| Contains required JSON fields | `set(required_keys).issubset(response.keys())` |
| Called the expected tool | `"search_database" in trace.tool_calls` |
| Output matches regex pattern | `re.match(pattern, output) is not None` |
| No PII in response | `pii_detector.scan(response) == []` |

**When to use objective scoring**: When success criteria can be expressed as computable predicates. If you can write a function that returns True/False, you have an objective eval.

### Subjective Evals (LLM Must Judge)

Subjective evaluations require reasoning about quality—something code alone cannot do. You use another LLM as the judge.

**Characteristics**:
- Results may vary slightly between runs (LLM non-determinism)
- Implemented as prompts to a grader LLM
- Slower and more expensive (requires inference)
- Captures nuanced quality dimensions

**Examples of subjective criteria**:

| Criterion | Why Code Can't Check |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Response is helpful | "Helpful" requires understanding context and user needs |
| Explanation is clear | Clarity depends on reader comprehension model |
| Tone is professional | Professionalism involves subtle linguistic choices |
| Summary captures key points | "Key" requires understanding importance hierarchy |
| Response addresses user's actual question | Intent interpretation requires reasoning |

**When to use subjective scoring**: When quality depends on semantic understanding that cannot be reduced to pattern matching. If the criterion requires "reading comprehension" to evaluate, you need an LLM judge.

### The Grading Implementation Difference

Here's how the same evaluation target—a customer support response—might use both approaches:

**Objective graders (code)**:

```python
def grade_format_compliance(response: dict) -> dict:
    """Check structural requirements with code."""
    checks = {
        "has_greeting": response.get("greeting") is not None,
        "has_resolution": response.get("resolution_steps") is not None,
        "under_300_words": len(response.get("body", "").split()) < 300,
        "no_profanity": not contains_profanity(response.get("body", ""))
    }
    return {
        "score": sum(checks.values()),
        "max_score": len(checks),
        "details": checks
    }
```

**Output:**

```
{"score": 3, "max_score": 4, "details": {"has_greeting": true, "has_resolution": true, "under_300_words": false, "no_profanity": true}}
```

**Subjective grader (LLM judge)**:

```python
JUDGE_PROMPT = """
Evaluate this customer support response on these criteria.
For EACH criterion, answer YES or NO:

1. Does the response acknowledge the customer's frustration?
2. Does it provide actionable next steps?
3. Is the tone empathetic but professional?
4. Does it avoid making promises the company can't keep?
5. Would you be satisfied receiving this response?

Response to evaluate:
{response}

Return JSON: {"criteria": [true/false, ...], "total_yes": N}
"""

def grade_quality(response: str, llm_client) -> dict:
    """Use LLM to evaluate quality dimensions."""
    result = llm_client.complete(
        JUDGE_PROMPT.format(response=response)
    )
    return json.loads(result)
```

**Output:**

```
{"criteria": [true, true, true, false, true], "total_yes": 4}
```

Notice the difference: the objective grader runs instantly with deterministic results. The subjective grader calls an LLM, costs money, and captures dimensions (empathy, actionability) that code cannot assess.

## Axis 2: Ground Truth vs No Ground Truth

### Per-Example Ground Truth

Some evaluations have reference answers for each test case. You compare agent output against the known correct answer.

**Characteristics**:
- Each test case includes expected output(s)
- Grader compares agent output to reference
- Can measure exact match, partial overlap, or semantic similarity
- Test data requires curation (someone must produce ground truth)

**Examples with ground truth**:

| Task | Ground Truth | How You Got It |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Invoice date extraction | The actual date from the invoice | Human labeled the invoice |
| Named entity recognition | List of entities that should be found | Annotated training data |
| QA from documents | The answer according to the document | Human read and answered |
| Code that should compile | The code compiles successfully | Verified by compiler |
| Translation | Professional human translation | Paid translator |

**When you have ground truth**: Your grader compares agent output to expected output. The comparison might be exact match, fuzzy match, or semantic similarity—but there's always a reference to compare against.

### No Per-Example Ground Truth

Other evaluations have no single correct answer. Quality is assessed against criteria or rubrics, not reference outputs.

**Characteristics**:
- Test cases include inputs but not expected outputs
- Grader evaluates quality against criteria, not against reference
- Multiple "correct" answers may exist
- Rubric-based scoring defines quality dimensions

**Examples without ground truth**:

| Task | Why No Ground Truth | How to Evaluate |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Creative writing | Many valid stories exist | Rubric: coherence, engagement, style |
| Open-ended advice | Context-dependent, no single right answer | Rubric: relevance, actionability, safety |
| Conversation quality | Good responses vary by personality/context | Rubric: appropriateness, helpfulness |
| Code review feedback | Multiple valid critiques exist | Rubric: accuracy, specificity, tone |
| Summary quality | Many valid summaries of same document | Rubric: coverage, conciseness, accuracy |

**When you lack ground truth**: Your grader applies a rubric—a set of criteria that define quality. No comparison to reference. Instead: does this output meet our quality standards?

## The Four Quadrants

Combining both axes creates four distinct evaluation types:

|  | **Objective (Code)** | **Subjective (LLM Judge)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-example ground truth** | **Q1**: Exact extraction, expected tool calls | **Q2**: Gold standard talking points, reference comparisons |
| **No per-example ground truth** | **Q3**: Format rules, length limits, constraint satisfaction | **Q4**: Rubric-based quality, helpfulness, clarity |

### Quadrant 1: Objective + Ground Truth

**What it looks like**: You have the correct answer. Code can verify if agent's answer matches.

**Real examples**:
- Invoice date extraction (expected: "2024-03-15", agent output must match)
- Tool call verification (expected: `search(query="user query")`, agent must call this)
- JSON schema validation (expected schema, output must conform)
- Math problem solving (expected: 42, agent output must equal)

**Grader pattern**:

```python
def grade_extraction(agent_output: str, expected: str) -> bool:
    """Direct comparison against ground truth."""
    return normalize(agent_output) == normalize(expected)
```

**Characteristics**: Cheapest, fastest, most reliable. Use whenever possible.

### Quadrant 2: Subjective + Ground Truth

**What it looks like**: You have reference content, but comparison requires judgment.

**Real examples**:
- Summary covers gold standard talking points (reference: 5 key points that must appear)
- Response addresses required topics (reference: checklist of must-mention items)
- Generated code implements specified functionality (reference: test cases it must pass)
- Report includes required findings (reference: expert-identified key findings)

**Grader pattern**:

```python
GRADER_PROMPT = """
How many of these required talking points appear in the response?

Required talking points:
{talking_points}

Response to evaluate:
{response}

For each talking point, determine if it's PRESENT or MISSING.
Return JSON: {"present": [...], "missing": [...], "score": N}
"""
```

**Characteristics**: More expensive (LLM calls), but can check semantic coverage, not just string matching.

### Quadrant 3: Objective + No Ground Truth

**What it looks like**: No single correct answer, but constraints are code-checkable.

**Real examples**:
- Response under 500 tokens (no "right" response, but length is measurable)
- Output contains no PII (any valid output works, PII detection is deterministic)
- Response is valid JSON (structure verifiable, content varies)
- No profanity in output (content can vary, profanity detection is code-based)

**Grader pattern**:

```python
def grade_constraints(output: str) -> dict:
    """Check constraint satisfaction without ground truth."""
    return {
        "under_limit": len(output.split()) < 200,
        "valid_json": is_valid_json(output),
        "no_pii": not detect_pii(output),
        "has_structure": contains_required_sections(output)
    }
```

**Characteristics**: Fast and cheap like Q1, but evaluates constraints rather than correctness.

### Quadrant 4: Subjective + No Ground Truth

**What it looks like**: Quality judgment against criteria, no reference answer.

**Real examples**:
- Response is helpful and addresses user needs (no single "helpful" response)
- Explanation is clear and well-structured (clarity is judgment call)
- Tone is appropriate for context (appropriateness requires reasoning)
- Creative output is engaging (engagement is subjective)

**Grader pattern**:

```python
RUBRIC_PROMPT = """
Evaluate this response against our quality rubric.
For EACH criterion, answer YES or NO:

1. Does it directly address what the user asked?
2. Is the information accurate (to your knowledge)?
3. Is it appropriately detailed for the question?
4. Is the tone suitable for a professional context?
5. Would a reasonable user find this helpful?

Response: {response}

Return JSON with boolean for each criterion and total count.
"""
```

**Characteristics**: Most expensive, captures nuanced quality, requires careful rubric design.

## Choosing Your Quadrant

When designing an eval, ask these questions in order:

**Question 1: Can you get ground truth for test cases?**

If you can label expected outputs for your test cases (or already have labeled data):
- You can use Quadrant 1 or 2
- Your evals will measure "correctness" against references

If labeling expected outputs is impossible or impractical:
- You must use Quadrant 3 or 4
- Your evals will measure "quality" against criteria

**Question 2: Can code verify your criteria?**

If success is deterministic (string match, format check, constraint satisfaction):
- Use Quadrant 1 (with GT) or Quadrant 3 (without GT)
- Your graders will be fast, cheap, and consistent

If success requires semantic understanding (helpfulness, clarity, relevance):
- Use Quadrant 2 (with GT) or Quadrant 4 (without GT)
- Your graders will use LLM-as-judge

**Decision flow**:

```
                    Ground Truth Available?
                    /                      \
                  YES                       NO
                  /                          \
        Code Can Verify?              Code Can Verify?
         /          \                  /          \
       YES          NO               YES          NO
        |            |                |            |
       Q1           Q2               Q3           Q4
   (Objective    (Subjective     (Objective    (Subjective
   + Ground      + Ground        + No GT)      + No GT)
    Truth)        Truth)
```

## Exercise: Classify Task API Evals

Your Task API agent helps users manage tasks. For each evaluation scenario below, identify the quadrant and explain your reasoning.

**Scenario 1**: Verify that when a user says "create a task called groceries", the agent calls `create_task(title="groceries")`.

**Scenario 2**: Check that task descriptions are under 500 characters.

**Scenario 3**: Evaluate whether the agent's task suggestions are relevant to the user's stated goals.

**Scenario 4**: Verify that the agent correctly extracts due dates from natural language (e.g., "next Tuesday" should resolve to the correct date).

**Scenario 5**: Assess whether the agent's responses are friendly and professional in tone.

**Work through each scenario**:
- Can you provide the "right answer" for each test case?
- Can code verify the criterion, or does it need judgment?

(Answers at end of lesson)

## Why This Classification Matters

Understanding quadrants prevents two costly mistakes:

**Mistake 1: Using LLM judges when code suffices**

If your criterion is code-checkable (Q1 or Q3), using an LLM judge wastes money and adds noise. A token counter is faster, cheaper, and more reliable than asking an LLM "is this under 500 tokens?"

**Mistake 2: Expecting code to check what requires judgment**

If your criterion needs semantic understanding (Q2 or Q4), code-based graders will miss the mark. Regex cannot determine if a response is "helpful"—you need an LLM judge with a well-designed rubric.

**The practical impact**:
- Misclassified Q1/Q3 as Q4 → Slow, expensive evals that should be instant
- Misclassified Q2/Q4 as Q1/Q3 → Brittle graders that miss quality issues
- Correct classification → Right tool for each job, reliable signal, manageable costs

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Classify Your Agent's Behaviors

```
I'm building an agent that [describe your agent]. Help me create an evaluation plan
by classifying these behaviors into the four quadrants:

1. [Behavior 1 - e.g., "extracts customer name from email"]
2. [Behavior 2 - e.g., "writes helpful responses"]
3. [Behavior 3 - e.g., "stays under token limits"]
4. [Behavior 4 - e.g., "handles angry customers appropriately"]

For each, tell me:
- Which quadrant (Q1-Q4)?
- Why? (ground truth available? code can check?)
- What grader approach should I use?
```

**What you're learning**: Applying the two-axis framework to your own agent, seeing how different behaviors require different evaluation strategies.

### Prompt 2: Design a Rubric for Q4 Evals

```
I need to evaluate whether my agent's [describe output, e.g., "task suggestions"]
are high quality. There's no single right answer, so I need a rubric.

Help me design 5 binary criteria (yes/no) that capture quality dimensions like:
- Relevance to user needs
- Actionability
- Appropriate detail level
- [Add your own]

Format as an LLM judge prompt I can use.
```

**What you're learning**: Rubric design for subjective evaluations—converting vague "quality" into measurable binary criteria that LLM judges can assess consistently.

### Prompt 3: Challenge the Classification

```
I classified this eval as [your quadrant]:
[Describe the eval]

Challenge my classification. Could it fit a different quadrant?
What would need to change to move it to a "cheaper" quadrant
(Q4 → Q3, Q2 → Q1)? Would that sacrifice important signal?
```

**What you're learning**: The tradeoffs between evaluation approaches—sometimes you can simplify without losing signal, sometimes "cheap" evals miss what matters.

### Safety Note

When using LLM-as-judge for subjective evals, remember that LLM judges have biases (like position bias when comparing two outputs). Test your graders on known-quality examples to ensure they produce sensible scores. Don't blindly trust LLM judgments any more than you'd blindly trust agent outputs.

## Reflect on Your Skill

After completing this lesson, consider updating your agent-evals skill with quadrant classification:

**Add to your skill's decision framework**:
- When analyzing a new eval need, first classify it into a quadrant
- Use quadrant to determine grader implementation approach
- Prefer lower quadrants (Q1 > Q2, Q3 > Q4) when possible for cost/reliability

**Key insight to encode**: The cheapest reliable eval is the best eval. Move toward Q1/Q3 whenever the criterion allows it.

## Exercise Answers

**Scenario 1**: Q1 (Objective + Ground Truth)
- Ground truth: Yes (the expected tool call is `create_task(title="groceries")`)
- Code can verify: Yes (compare actual tool call to expected)
- Grader: Exact match on tool name and arguments

**Scenario 2**: Q3 (Objective + No Ground Truth)
- Ground truth: No (there's no single "correct" description, just a constraint)
- Code can verify: Yes (`len(description) &lt; 500`)
- Grader: Character/word count function

**Scenario 3**: Q4 (Subjective + No Ground Truth)
- Ground truth: No (relevance depends on context, many valid suggestions)
- Code can verify: No (requires understanding user goals and suggestion relevance)
- Grader: LLM judge with relevance rubric

**Scenario 4**: Q1 (Objective + Ground Truth)
- Ground truth: Yes (each natural language date has a correct resolution)
- Code can verify: Yes (compare resolved date to expected date)
- Grader: Date comparison function

**Scenario 5**: Q4 (Subjective + No Ground Truth)
- Ground truth: No (no single "correct" friendly response)
- Code can verify: No ("friendly" and "professional" require judgment)
- Grader: LLM judge with tone rubric
