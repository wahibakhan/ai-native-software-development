# Chapter 47: Evals - Measuring Agent Performance

**Part**: 6 (AI Native Software Development)
**Phase**: Quality Assurance
**Proficiency Level**: B1-B2 (Intermediate to Upper Intermediate)
**Duration**: ~4.5 hours

## Chapter Overview

This chapter teaches the **thinking and methodology** behind agent evaluations (evals)—the systematic approach to measuring AI agent reasoning quality. Unlike TDD (Chapter 46) which tests code correctness with deterministic PASS/FAIL outcomes, evals measure probabilistic reasoning quality with scores.

**Core Thesis** (Andrew Ng): *"One of the biggest predictors for whether someone is able to build agentic workflows really well is whether or not they're able to drive a really disciplined evaluation process."*

## Prerequisites

- **Ch34-36 (SDK chapters)**: Understanding of agent architecture
- **Ch40 (FastAPI for Agents)**: Task API running example
- **Ch46 (TDD for Agents)**: Understanding of test-driven development

## Student Skill

Students build the `agent-evals` skill throughout this chapter, starting with L00 and finalizing in L10.

## Lesson Index

| # | Lesson | Duration | Focus |
|---|--------|----------|-------|
| L00 | Build Your Evals Skill | 25 min | Skill-First: Create agent-evals skill |
| L01 | Evals Are Exams for Reasoning | 20 min | TDD vs Evals distinction |
| L02 | The Two Evaluation Axes | 20 min | Four-quadrant classification |

| L04 | Building Graders with Binary Criteria | 30 min | Binary yes/no pattern |
| L05 | LLM-as-Judge Graders | 30 min | LLM evaluation with limitations |
| L06 | Systematic Error Analysis | 30 min | Spreadsheet-based counting |
| L07 | Component vs End-to-End Evals | 25 min | Decision framework |
| L08 | Regression Protection | 25 min | Eval-on-every-change |
| L09 | The Complete Quality Loop | 30 min | Build-Evaluate-Analyze-Improve |
| L10 | Finalize Your Evals Skill | 20 min | Skill validation |

## Key Concepts

- **Evals as Exams**: Testing reasoning quality, not code correctness
- **Two Axes**: Objective/Subjective × Ground Truth availability
- **Binary Criteria**: 5 yes/no checks → 0-5 score (more reliable than 1-5 scales)
- **Error Analysis**: Systematic counting replaces gut feeling
- **The Quality Loop**: Build → Evaluate → Analyze → Improve → Repeat

## Running Example

Task API agent from Ch40, evaluated for:
- Routing decisions (create vs update vs query)
- Tool selection correctness
- Output format compliance
- Error handling quality

## Learning Outcomes

By chapter end, students can:
1. Distinguish evals from TDD based on determinism and outcomes
2. Design eval datasets with typical, edge, and error cases
3. Create graders using binary criteria
4. Perform systematic error analysis
5. Build regression protection workflows
6. Apply the complete quality loop

## Framework-Agnostic

These concepts apply to any SDK (OpenAI, Claude, Google ADK, LangChain). The thinking is portable.
