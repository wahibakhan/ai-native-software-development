# RAG Architecture Patterns (Capstone)

Your Task API now has semantic search—users query in natural language and find related tasks. But what happens when a user asks a complex question like "Show me all deployment-related tasks, explain the common patterns, and suggest which I should tackle first based on my current workload"?

Simple RAG retrieves documents and generates answers. But production systems need more: conversation memory, quality validation, adaptive strategies, and multi-step reasoning. This capstone lesson equips you with the architectural patterns to build RAG systems that match real-world complexity.

The architecture remains clean throughout:
- **LangChain**: Embeddings, vector store, similarity search
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: All LLM calls, agent orchestration, conversation memory

By the end of this lesson, you will understand eight RAG architectures—from basic retrieval to autonomous agents—and implement at least two for your Task API.

---

## The Eight RAG Architectures

RAG has evolved from a simple "retrieve then generate" pattern into a family of architectures, each optimized for different requirements.

| Architecture | Retrieval Strategy | Agent Pattern | Best For |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Simple RAG** | Single query, top-K | Agent + search tool | FAQ systems, known-scope knowledge |
| **Simple RAG + Memory** | Context-aware query | Agent + SQLiteSession | Multi-turn chatbots, support systems |
| **Branched RAG** | Intent-routed to specialized retrievers | Agent + multiple search tools | Multi-domain knowledge bases |
| **HyDE** | Hypothetical document embedding | Agent generates hypothesis first | Vague queries, abstract questions |
| **Adaptive RAG** | Complexity-driven strategy | Agent with analyze + search tools | Variable query complexity |
| **Corrective RAG (CRAG)** | Graded retrieval with fallback | Agent grades and re-searches | High-accuracy requirements |
| **Self-RAG** | Iterative self-retrieval | Agent self-assesses and refines | Research assistants, exploratory queries |
| **Agentic RAG** | Multi-tool orchestration | Multi-agent with handoffs | Complex research, decision support |

---

## Shared Setup

All patterns use this common foundation:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, SQLiteSession
from langchain_qdrant import QdrantVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# LangChain: Retrieval Layer
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
vector_store = QdrantVectorStore.from_existing_collection(
    embedding=embeddings,
    url="http://localhost:6333",
    collection_name="task_docs",
)


def format_docs(docs) -> str:
    """Format retrieved documents for context."""
    if not docs:
        return "No relevant documents found."
    formatted = []
    for i, doc in enumerate(docs, 1):
        source = doc.metadata.get("source", "unknown")
        formatted.append(f"[{i}. {source}]\n{doc.page_content}")
    return "\n\n---\n\n".join(formatted)


@function_tool
def search_docs(query: str) -> str:
    """Search Task API documentation for relevant information.

    Args:
        query: What to search for in the documentation.
    """
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=4)
    return format_docs(docs)
```

---

## Pattern 1: Simple RAG

The foundation. Agent uses a search tool to retrieve context, then generates an answer.

```
User Query → Agent calls search_docs → Agent generates answer with context
```

```python
simple_rag_agent = Agent(
    name="SimpleRAG",
    instructions="""You answer questions about the Task API.

When users ask questions:
1. Use search_docs to find relevant documentation
2. Answer based ONLY on retrieved information
3. If docs don't cover the topic, say so clearly

Never make up information.""",
    tools=[search_docs],
)

# Run it
result = Runner.run_sync(
    simple_rag_agent,
    "How do I create a new task with high priority?"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
To create a new task with high priority, use the POST /tasks endpoint:

```json
{
  "title": "Your task title",
  "description": "Task details",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

The API returns the created task with its assigned ID.
```

**When to use Simple RAG:**
- Static knowledge bases with well-defined scope
- FAQ systems where questions map clearly to documentation
- Low-latency requirements

---

## Pattern 2: Simple RAG with Memory

The Agents SDK handles conversation memory automatically with sessions.

```
User Query + Session History → Agent retrieves with context awareness → Answer
```

```python
memory_rag_agent = Agent(
    name="MemoryRAG",
    instructions="""You answer questions about the Task API.

Remember the conversation context. When users say things like
"what about high priority?" or "and for deletion?", understand
they're referring to previous topics.

Use search_docs for information. Answer from documentation only.""",
    tools=[search_docs],
)

# Create persistent session
session = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")

# First question
result1 = Runner.run_sync(
    memory_rag_agent,
    "Show me all deployment tasks",
    session=session
)
print("Q1:", result1.final_output)

# Follow-up that needs context
result2 = Runner.run_sync(
    memory_rag_agent,
    "Which one should I start with?",  # References "deployment tasks"
    session=session
)
print("Q2:", result2.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
Q1: Based on the documentation, deployment-related tasks include:
1. Docker Setup - Configure Docker Desktop
2. K8s Config - Set up Kubernetes cluster
3. CI/CD Pipeline - Configure automated deployments

Q2: Based on the deployment workflow in the documentation, you should
start with Docker Setup. It's the foundation - K8s and CI/CD both
depend on having Docker configured correctly.
```

The agent understood "Which one should I start with?" refers to the deployment tasks from the previous turn.

**When to use Memory RAG:**
- Customer support chatbots
- Multi-turn conversation interfaces
- Any context-dependent interactions

---

## Pattern 3: Branched RAG (Router RAG)

Give the agent multiple specialized search tools. It routes queries automatically based on tool descriptions.

```
Query → Agent chooses appropriate search tool → Specialized retrieval → Answer
```

```python
# Create specialized vector stores (in production, these are separate collections)
# For demo, we'll create tools with different search behaviors

@function_tool
def search_api_docs(query: str) -> str:
    """Search API reference documentation for endpoints, schemas, and parameters.

    Args:
        query: Technical query about API endpoints or data structures.
    """
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
        query,
        k=4,
        filter={"doc_type": "api_reference"}  # Metadata filter
    )
    return format_docs(docs)


@function_tool
def search_tutorials(query: str) -> str:
    """Search tutorials and how-to guides for step-by-step instructions.

    Args:
        query: How-to query about accomplishing a workflow.
    """
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
        query,
        k=3,
        filter={"doc_type": "tutorial"}
    )
    return format_docs(docs)


@function_tool
def search_troubleshooting(query: str) -> str:
    """Search troubleshooting guides for error resolution and debugging.

    Args:
        query: Query about errors, issues, or debugging.
    """
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
        query,
        k=3,
        filter={"doc_type": "troubleshooting"}
    )
    return format_docs(docs)


branched_agent = Agent(
    name="BranchedRAG",
    instructions="""You help users with the Task API.

Choose the most appropriate search tool:
- search_api_docs: Technical reference (endpoints, schemas)
- search_tutorials: Step-by-step guides
- search_troubleshooting: Error resolution, debugging

You can use multiple tools if needed for comprehensive answers.""",
    tools=[search_api_docs, search_tutorials, search_troubleshooting],
)

# Test - agent should route to troubleshooting
result = Runner.run_sync(
    branched_agent,
    "Why am I getting a 500 error on task creation?"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
Based on the troubleshooting guide, a 500 error on task creation typically means:

1. **Database connection issue** - Check QDRANT_URL is accessible
2. **Missing required fields** - Ensure "title" is present in request body
3. **Validation error** - Priority must be "low", "medium", or "high"

Check your request body format:
```json
{"title": "Required", "priority": "medium"}
```
```

**When to use Branched RAG:**
- Multi-domain knowledge bases
- When specialized indexes improve retrieval quality
- Systems with distinct document categories

---

## Pattern 4: HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)

For vague queries, generate a hypothetical answer first, then use that for retrieval.

```
Vague Query → Agent generates hypothesis → Search with hypothesis → Final answer
```

```python
@function_tool
def search_with_hypothesis(query: str, hypothesis: str) -> str:
    """Search using a hypothetical answer for better retrieval.

    Args:
        query: The original user question.
        hypothesis: A hypothetical answer to use for retrieval.
    """
    # Use hypothesis for embedding (closer to actual docs in vector space)
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(hypothesis, k=4)
    return f"Original query: {query}\n\nRetrieved context:\n{format_docs(docs)}"


hyde_agent = Agent(
    name="HyDERAG",
    instructions="""You answer questions using the HyDE pattern.

For vague or abstract queries:
1. First, generate a hypothetical detailed answer (what you THINK the answer might be)
2. Then call search_with_hypothesis with both the query and your hypothesis
3. Finally, generate the real answer based on retrieved documents

This works because hypothetical answers are often closer in meaning
to actual documentation than vague questions.

For direct factual questions, just use the search normally.""",
    tools=[search_docs, search_with_hypothesis],
)

# Vague query that would struggle with direct retrieval
result = Runner.run_sync(
    hyde_agent,
    "What's the best way to organize my work?"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
Based on the Task API documentation, here's how to organize your work effectively:

1. **Use Priority Levels**: Assign "high", "medium", or "low" priority to tasks
   ```
   GET /tasks?priority=high
   ```

2. **Filter by Status**: Track progress with status filters
   ```
   GET /tasks?status=pending
   GET /tasks?status=in_progress
   ```

3. **Combine Filters**: Find specific task sets
   ```
   GET /tasks?priority=high&status=pending
   ```

4. **Use Semantic Search**: Find related tasks by meaning
   ```
   POST /tasks/search/semantic?query=deployment
   ```
```

**When to use HyDE:**
- Research systems with abstract queries
- Conceptual rather than factual questions
- Improving recall when queries lack exact keywords

**Tradeoff:** Adds one LLM generation before retrieval (increased latency).

---

## Pattern 5: Adaptive RAG

Analyze query complexity and adapt strategy. Simple queries get fast retrieval; complex queries get thorough multi-source retrieval.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal


class QueryAnalysis(BaseModel):
    complexity: Literal["simple", "moderate", "complex"]
    strategy: str


@function_tool
def analyze_query(query: str) -> str:
    """Analyze query complexity to determine retrieval strategy.

    Args:
        query: The user's question to analyze.
    """
    # In production, this could be a separate fast classifier
    return f"Analyzing: {query}"


@function_tool
def search_minimal(query: str) -> str:
    """Fast minimal search for simple factual queries (2 docs).

    Args:
        query: Simple factual question.
    """
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)
    return format_docs(docs)


@function_tool
def search_thorough(query: str) -> str:
    """Thorough search for complex queries (6 docs, diverse).

    Args:
        query: Complex query needing multiple perspectives.
    """
    docs = vector_store.max_marginal_relevance_search(
        query, k=6, fetch_k=20
    )
    return format_docs(docs)


adaptive_agent = Agent(
    name="AdaptiveRAG",
    instructions="""You adapt your retrieval strategy based on query complexity.

Classify each query:
- SIMPLE: Direct factual question ("What is the status field?")
  → Use search_minimal for fast response
- MODERATE: Needs a few sources ("How do I filter tasks?")
  → Use search_docs (standard 4 docs)
- COMPLEX: Needs breadth ("How should I restructure my workflow?")
  → Use search_thorough for comprehensive coverage

State your complexity assessment, then search appropriately.""",
    tools=[search_minimal, search_docs, search_thorough],
    output_type=None,  # Free-form output
)

# Simple query - should use minimal search
result1 = Runner.run_sync(
    adaptive_agent,
    "What is the status field in a task?"
)
print("Simple:", result1.final_output[:200])

# Complex query - should use thorough search
result2 = Runner.run_sync(
    adaptive_agent,
    "How should I restructure my task workflow for a team of 5?"
)
print("\nComplex:", result2.final_output[:200])
```

**Output:**
```
Simple: [Complexity: SIMPLE] The status field in a task indicates its current
state. Valid values are: "pending" (not started), "in_progress" (being worked
on), and "completed" (finished).

Complex: [Complexity: COMPLEX] For a team of 5, I recommend structuring your
Task API workflow around these patterns from the documentation:

1. **Priority-based queues** - Each team member filters by priority...
```

**When to use Adaptive RAG:**
- Enterprise search with variable query types
- Cost-sensitive systems (minimize tokens for simple queries)
- Systems needing both speed and thoroughness

---

## Pattern 6: Corrective RAG (CRAG)

Grade retrieved documents for relevance. If quality is low, search again or acknowledge uncertainty.

```python
@function_tool
def search_and_grade(query: str) -> str:
    """Search and grade document relevance.

    Args:
        query: The search query.
    """
    results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=4)

    if not results:
        return "NO_DOCS_FOUND"

    # Grade by relevance score (lower = more similar for cosine)
    graded = []
    for doc, score in results:
        relevance = "HIGH" if score < 0.3 else "MEDIUM" if score < 0.5 else "LOW"
        source = doc.metadata.get("source", "unknown")
        graded.append(f"[{relevance}] {source}\n{doc.page_content[:300]}")

    high_relevance_count = sum(1 for d, s in results if s < 0.3)

    header = f"Retrieved {len(results)} docs ({high_relevance_count} high relevance)\n\n"
    return header + "\n\n---\n\n".join(graded)


@function_tool
def search_broader(query: str) -> str:
    """Broader search when initial results are poor quality.

    Args:
        query: Reformulated broader query.
    """
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=6)
    return f"BROADER SEARCH:\n{format_docs(docs)}"


crag_agent = Agent(
    name="CorrectiveRAG",
    instructions="""You use Corrective RAG - always verify retrieval quality.

Workflow:
1. Use search_and_grade to retrieve and assess documents
2. Check the relevance grades:
   - If 2+ HIGH relevance docs: Answer confidently
   - If only MEDIUM relevance: Answer but note uncertainty
   - If mostly LOW relevance: Use search_broader with a reformulated query
3. If still low quality after broader search: Honestly say you don't have
   good information on this topic

Never fabricate information. Acknowledge uncertainty when retrieval is poor.""",
    tools=[search_and_grade, search_broader],
)

# Test with a query that might have low relevance
result = Runner.run_sync(
    crag_agent,
    "How do I handle task dependencies in the API?"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
I searched for information about task dependencies.

**Retrieval Quality**: 3/4 documents had HIGH relevance.

**Answer**: Task dependencies in the API are managed through the `depends_on`
field when creating or updating tasks:

```json
POST /tasks
{
  "title": "Deploy to production",
  "depends_on": [task_id_1, task_id_2]
}
```

A task with dependencies cannot be marked complete until all dependency
tasks are completed. The API returns 400 Bad Request if you try.
```

**When to use CRAG:**
- Legal, medical, financial domains (wrong answers have consequences)
- When retrieval quality varies significantly
- Systems that must acknowledge uncertainty

---

## Pattern 7: Self-RAG

The agent assesses its own answer, identifies gaps, and retrieves more information to fill them.

```python
@function_tool
def assess_answer_completeness(question: str, answer: str) -> str:
    """Assess if an answer fully addresses the question.

    Args:
        question: The original question.
        answer: The generated answer to assess.
    """
    # This returns assessment for the agent to decide next steps
    return f"Assessing completeness of answer for: {question}\nAnswer preview: {answer[:200]}..."


self_rag_agent = Agent(
    name="SelfRAG",
    instructions="""You use Self-RAG - iteratively improve your answers.

Workflow:
1. Search for initial information with search_docs
2. Generate a preliminary answer
3. Self-assess: Does your answer fully address the question?
4. If gaps exist:
   - Identify what's missing
   - Search again with a focused query for the missing info
   - Integrate new information
5. Repeat until answer is complete (max 3 iterations)

Be explicit about your self-assessment process.
State when you're searching for additional information and why.""",
    tools=[search_docs, assess_answer_completeness],
)

# Complex query that may need iteration
result = Runner.run_sync(
    self_rag_agent,
    "Explain the complete lifecycle of a task from creation to completion, including all state transitions and what triggers them"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
**Initial search**: Found documentation on task states and transitions.

**Preliminary answer**: Tasks move through pending → in_progress → completed.

**Self-assessment**: Missing details on what triggers each transition.

**Additional search**: Searched for "task state transition triggers API"

**Complete answer**:

The task lifecycle has three states with these transitions:

1. **pending** (initial state)
   - Created via POST /tasks
   - Trigger: Task creation

2. **pending → in_progress**
   - Trigger: PATCH /tasks/{id} with {"status": "in_progress"}
   - Can only transition from pending

3. **in_progress → completed**
   - Trigger: PATCH /tasks/{id} with {"status": "completed"}
   - Records completion_timestamp automatically
   - Triggers configured webhooks

Invalid transitions (return 400):
- completed → any state (tasks cannot be "un-completed")
- pending → completed (must go through in_progress)
```

**When to use Self-RAG:**
- Research assistants
- Exploratory queries
- When thoroughness matters more than speed

---

## Pattern 8: Agentic RAG (Multi-Agent)

Multiple specialized agents hand off to each other based on expertise.

```python
from agents import handoff

# Specialized agents
api_expert = Agent(
    name="APIExpert",
    instructions="""You are an expert on Task API endpoints and schemas.
Answer technical questions about API structure, parameters, and responses.
Use search_api_docs for information.""",
    tools=[search_api_docs],
)

workflow_expert = Agent(
    name="WorkflowExpert",
    instructions="""You are an expert on task management workflows.
Answer questions about organizing work, prioritization, and best practices.
Use search_tutorials for information.""",
    tools=[search_tutorials],
)

troubleshooter = Agent(
    name="Troubleshooter",
    instructions="""You are an expert on debugging Task API issues.
Help users resolve errors, understand logs, and fix problems.
Use search_troubleshooting for information.""",
    tools=[search_troubleshooting],
)

# Triage agent routes to specialists
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="TaskAPIAssistant",
    instructions="""You triage Task API questions to the right specialist.

Assess the query and hand off to:
- APIExpert: Technical questions about endpoints, schemas, parameters
- WorkflowExpert: Questions about organizing work, best practices
- Troubleshooter: Error messages, debugging, issues

You can also answer simple questions directly using search_docs.""",
    tools=[search_docs],
    handoffs=[api_expert, workflow_expert, troubleshooter],
)

# Test agentic handoff
result = Runner.run_sync(
    triage_agent,
    "I'm getting a validation error when creating tasks with custom fields"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
[Handed off to Troubleshooter]

Based on the troubleshooting documentation, validation errors with custom
fields typically occur because:

1. **Unknown field names**: The API only accepts defined fields (title,
   description, priority, status). Custom fields require schema extension.

2. **Type mismatch**: If you've extended the schema, ensure field types match.

**Solution**: Check your request body matches the TaskCreate schema:
```json
{
  "title": "string (required)",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "priority": "low|medium|high",
  "status": "pending|in_progress|completed"
}
```

For custom fields, you'll need to extend the Pydantic model in `models/task.py`.
```

**When to use Agentic RAG:**
- Complex domains requiring specialized expertise
- Multi-step research tasks
- Decision support systems

## Capstone Project: Task API RAG System

Implement at least two patterns for your Task API:

### Required: Simple RAG (Baseline)

```python
# Your implementation from Pattern 1
simple_agent = Agent(...)
```

### Choose One Advanced Pattern

**Option A: HyDE** (for better handling of vague queries)
```python
# Implement Pattern 4
hyde_agent = Agent(...)
```

**Option B: CRAG** (for high-accuracy requirements)
```python
# Implement Pattern 6
crag_agent = Agent(...)
```

**Option C: Agentic RAG** (for multi-domain expertise)
```python
# Implement Pattern 8
triage_agent = Agent(...)
```

### Test Your Implementation

```python
test_queries = [
    # Simple factual (baseline handles well)
    "What fields does a task have?",

    # Vague query (benefits from HyDE)
    "How can I be more productive?",

    # Error scenario (benefits from CRAG uncertainty handling)
    "What causes the XYZ-999 error?",

    # Multi-step (benefits from Agentic)
    "Help me plan a deployment workflow for my team"
]

for query in test_queries:
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print(f"Simple RAG: {Runner.run_sync(simple_agent, query).final_output[:100]}...")
    print(f"Advanced: {Runner.run_sync(advanced_agent, query).final_output[:100]}...")
    print("-" * 50)
```

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `rag-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Test whether it handles architecture patterns.

### Test Your Skill

Ask your skill:

```
I need to build a RAG system for a legal document review application.
Users ask both simple questions ("What is clause 5?") and complex
questions ("How do these contracts compare on liability terms?").

Wrong answers could have legal consequences, so I need to handle
uncertainty gracefully.

Which RAG architecture(s) should I use? Show me the implementation
using LangChain for retrieval and OpenAI Agents SDK for orchestration.
```

### Identify Gaps

After reviewing the response:
- Does it recommend CRAG for the uncertainty requirement?
- Does it suggest Adaptive RAG for handling both simple and complex queries?
- Does it show the correct architecture (LangChain retrieval + Agents SDK)?
- Does it demonstrate grading documents for relevance?

### Improve Your Skill

If gaps exist, update your skill:

```
Update my rag-deployment skill with architecture selection guidance:
1. When to use each of 8 RAG patterns
2. How to implement CRAG with document grading
3. How to combine patterns (e.g., Adaptive + CRAG)
4. Tradeoff analysis (latency vs accuracy vs complexity)
5. Always use LangChain for retrieval, Agents SDK for orchestration
```

Your skill should now guide architecture decisions for production RAG systems.

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Combine Patterns

```
I want to build a RAG system that:
1. Remembers conversation history (Memory RAG)
2. Grades document relevance (CRAG)
3. Adapts strategy based on query complexity (Adaptive)

Help me design an agent that combines these patterns.
Use LangChain for retrieval and OpenAI Agents SDK for orchestration.
```

**What you're learning:** Production systems often combine patterns. Understanding how they compose is key to architecture design.

### Prompt 2: Add Evaluation

```
Take my CRAG implementation and add evaluation from Lesson 7.
I want to track:
- How often the agent triggers the "broader search" fallback
- Average relevance scores of retrieved documents
- User satisfaction with answers

Show me how to instrument the agent with these metrics.
```

**What you're learning:** RAG systems need monitoring to identify when retrieval quality degrades or when patterns need adjustment.

### Prompt 3: Production Deployment

```
I've implemented Agentic RAG for my Task API with three specialist agents.
Now I need to:
1. Deploy it as a FastAPI endpoint
2. Add rate limiting
3. Handle agent timeouts gracefully
4. Log all agent handoffs for debugging

Show me the production-ready FastAPI integration.
```

**What you're learning:** Moving from prototype to production requires operational considerations beyond just the RAG logic.
