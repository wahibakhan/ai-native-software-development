# Chapter 43: Vector Databases & RAG with LangChain

**You will build a RAG skill BEFORE you learn RAG concepts.**

This chapter follows the **Skill-First Learning Pattern**: In Lesson 0, you create a `rag-deployment` skill using tools from Chapter 5. Then you spend the chapter understanding what you built and making it better. By the end, you don't just "know RAG"—you OWN a production-ready skill that extends your Task API with semantic search.

## The Architecture

This chapter uses a clean separation of concerns:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Ingestion** | LangChain | Document loading, text splitting, embeddings |
| **Storage/Retrieval** | LangChain + Qdrant | Vector store, similarity search |
| **Intelligence** | OpenAI Agents SDK | Agent orchestration, LLM calls, conversation memory |
| **Evaluation** | RAGAS + LangSmith | Quality metrics, tracing |

**Why this split?** LangChain excels at document processing and retrieval. The Agents SDK (Chapter 34) excels at agent orchestration. Together, they give you the best of both worlds without framework lock-in.

## Chapter Structure

| # | Lesson | Duration | Your Skill Improves |
|---|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **0** | **Build Your RAG Skill** | 20 min | **Created from LangChain docs** |
| 1 | Why Agents Need External Knowledge | 25 min | Conceptual: parametric vs retrieval |
| 2 | Vector Embeddings Mental Model | 30 min | Conceptual: semantic similarity |
| 3 | LangChain Document Processing | 40 min | Add: chunking strategies |
| 4 | Qdrant Vector Store | 45 min | Add: vector storage patterns |
| 5 | RAG with OpenAI Agents SDK | 45 min | Add: agent + retrieval tool pattern |
| 6 | RAG for Task API | 50 min | Refine: semantic search endpoint |
| 7 | Evaluating RAG Quality | 45 min | Add: evaluation metrics |
| **8** | **RAG Architecture Patterns** | 60 min | **Capstone: 2 patterns implemented** |

## Every Lesson Has Skill Reflection

Each lesson ends with **"Reflect on Your Skill"**:

1. **Test**: Does your skill handle this lesson's concepts?
2. **Identify gaps**: What's missing?
3. **Improve**: Add or refine the capability

By Lesson 8, you've tested and improved your skill 8+ times.

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 40**: FastAPI for Agents (Task API foundation)
- **Chapters 34-36**: Agent SDK chapters (agents know how to call tools)
- **Chapter 5**: skill-creator and fetching-library-docs
- **Docker**: For running Qdrant locally

## The Running Example

**Your Task API gets smarter.** In Chapter 40, you built a Task API with CRUD operations. Now you extend it:

- **Lessons 1-5**: Learn how RAG works—embeddings, Qdrant, retrieval chains
- **Lesson 6**: Add `/tasks/search/semantic` endpoint to your Task API
- **Lesson 8**: Implement advanced RAG patterns for intelligent task recommendations

The key insight: **Semantic search lets users find tasks by meaning, not just keywords**.

## What You'll Own

This skill joins your growing **Digital FTE toolkit**.

## The Mindset Shift

**Traditional**: "Teach me RAG"
**Agent Factory**: "I own a RAG skill—help me make it better"

You're not here to learn. You're here to **build assets**.
