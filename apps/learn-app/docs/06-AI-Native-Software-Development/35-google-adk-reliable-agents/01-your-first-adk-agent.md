# Your First ADK Agent

Imagine you're building a news research system that autonomously gathers information about emerging technologies. You don't want to write imperative code orchestrating every API call and data flow. Instead, you declare what the agent should do—research, synthesize, and report—and let the framework handle the execution. This is where Google's Agent Development Kit shines.

You've built agents with OpenAI's procedural SDK in Chapter 34, where you construct agents imperatively through code. Google ADK takes a different philosophy: **declarative agent design**. You specify agent structure through configuration and type annotations, and ADK handles the orchestration. This approach scales better to complex multi-agent systems and integrates deeply with Google Cloud's production infrastructure.

This lesson walks you through installation, your first ADK agent powered by Gemini, and how the declarative approach differs from the SDK pattern you already know. By the end, you'll understand when to choose ADK's structured approach over OpenAI's flexibility.

## Installation and Project Setup

Before building agents, you need Google ADK installed and your development environment configured.

### Step 1: Install Google ADK

Open your terminal and install the google-adk package:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

This installs the core ADK framework with dependencies. Verify the installation worked:

```bash
pip show google-adk
```

**Output:**
```
Name: google-adk
Version: X.Y.Z  # Check PyPI for current version
Location: /path/to/your/python/site-packages
```

If installation succeeds, you're ready to scaffold a project.

### Step 2: Create Your First Agent Project

ADK provides a scaffolding tool to initialize agent projects with best practices. Run:

```bash
adk create --type=code my_news_agent
```

This creates a project directory with the following structure:

```
my_news_agent/
├── agent.py          # Main agent code
├── agent.yaml        # Agent configuration (optional, for declarative definition)
├── .env              # Environment variables (API keys, project IDs)
├── __init__.py       # Package marker
└── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
```

Navigate into your project:

```bash
cd my_news_agent
```

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key

ADK supports two authentication backends:

**Option A: Google AI (Free Tier)**

Get a free API key from https://ai.google.dev/. Then create a `.env` file in your project:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Option B: Vertex AI (Google Cloud)**

If you have a Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled, set:

```
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
```

For this lesson, Option A (Google AI with free key) is simplest. ADK automatically loads `.env` when you run agents.

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

Create a verification script `verify_setup.py`:

```python
import os
from google.genai import Client

api_key = os.getenv('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    print("ERROR: GOOGLE_API_KEY not set in .env")
else:
    print(f"API Key found: {api_key[:20]}...")
    # Optional: Test client initialization
    client = Client(api_key=api_key)
    print("Google AI client initialized successfully")
```

**Output:**
```
API Key found: AIzaSyD...
Google AI client initialized successfully
```

## Your First Agent

Now let's build a working agent. This introduces ADK's declarative approach.

### The Declarative Pattern

Unlike OpenAI's imperative SDK (define agent → run → extract result), ADK uses a **declarative model**:

1. **Define the Agent** — Specify agent properties (name, instructions, tools) through code or YAML
2. **Add Tools** — Equip agent with capabilities (google_search, custom functions)
3. **Run with CLI** — Use `adk run` or `adk web` to interact

The key difference: ADK separates agent **definition** from **execution**, making configuration reusable across environments.

### Hello World Agent

Create a file `agent.py`:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

# Define the agent declaratively
root_agent = Agent(
    name="ai_news_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="You are an AI News Assistant. Use Google Search to find recent AI news and summarize findings clearly.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

That's it. No runner object needed. No manual orchestration. ADK handles execution.

### Running Your Agent

Now use ADK's CLI tools to interact with your agent.

**Terminal Interaction:**

```bash
adk run agent.py
```

This starts an interactive terminal session. Type your queries:

```
You: What are the latest developments in AI agents?

Agent: I'll search for recent AI agent developments for you.
[Searching for "latest AI agent developments 2025"...]

Based on recent news, here are key developments:
1. Multi-agent systems becoming mainstream with frameworks like ADK
2. Voice agents gaining adoption with Gemini's Live API
3. Enterprise deployment through Vertex AI Agent Engine
...
```

**Web Interface (Recommended for Learning):**

```bash
adk web
```

This opens a web UI at `http://localhost:8000` with a chat interface AND an Events tab showing agent reasoning.

The Events tab is crucial for understanding how your agent works:
- **Tool calls**: See which tools the agent used and when
- **Model reasoning**: Watch the agent's thinking process
- **Parameters**: Inspect what arguments were passed to each tool
- **Results**: See what each tool returned

This transparency is one of ADK's core strengths for production agents.

## Understanding the Declarative Approach

Let's break down why ADK's design matters.

### Agent Definition (Code)

```python
root_agent = Agent(
    name="ai_news_agent",                     # Human-readable identifier
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",                 # Gemini model to use
    instruction="You are an AI News Assistant...",  # Agent behavior (singular!)
    tools=[google_search]                     # Agent capabilities
)
```

**Compare to OpenAI SDK** (Chapter 34):

```python
# OpenAI: Imperative approach
agent = Agent(
    name="NewsResearcher",
    instruction="You are..."
    # Tools added separately through definitions or context
)

# Then you orchestrate:
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "What's new in AI?")
print(result.final_output)
```

**ADK difference:**

- Agent configuration is self-contained (name, instructions, tools together)
- Execution is abstracted into CLI commands, not code
- This separates concerns: developers define agents; operators run them

### Tool Integration

Google ADK provides built-in tools:

- **google_search** — Web search without needing API keys
- **code_execution** — Python code running in sandboxed environment
- **file_access** — Read/write files safely

You simply add them to the `tools` list:

```python
from google.adk.tools import google_search
from google.adk.code_executors import BuiltInCodeExecutor

root_agent = Agent(
    name="research_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="Research questions and validate answers with code.",
    tools=[google_search],
    code_executor=BuiltInCodeExecutor()  # Enables code execution
)
```

Custom tools (your own functions) come later in Lesson 2.

### Gemini Model Selection

ADK defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`, a fast, efficient model suitable for most agent tasks. If you want different models:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="ai_news_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-001",  # For voice/streaming support
    instruction="You are an AI News Assistant.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

**Key model choices:**

- `gemini-2.5-flash` — Fast, good for tooling (default)
- `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` — Voice/video streaming support
- `gemini-1.5-pro` — Higher reasoning capability (slower)

## Comparing ADK to OpenAI SDK

By now you've seen both approaches. Here's how they differ:

| Aspect | OpenAI SDK | Google ADK |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Design Pattern** | Imperative (code orchestrates execution) | Declarative (config specifies agent) |
| **Tool Definition** | Pydantic models, explicit function wrapping | Type annotations, auto-wrapped functions |
| **Execution** | `Runner.run_sync()` in code | `adk run` / `adk web` CLI |
| **State Management** | `context_variables` parameter passing | `ToolContext` for persistent state (Lesson 3) |
| **Multi-Agent** | Handoffs (flexible but manual) | Workflow agents (deterministic pipelines) |
| **Safety** | Input/output validation | 6 callback types for granular control |
| **Debugging** | Print statements or external logging | Events tab in `adk web` UI |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted anywhere | Vertex AI Agent Engine (managed) |

**When to choose ADK:**

- Building production agents at scale (Vertex AI integration)
- Needing transparent debugging (Events tab)
- Creating deterministic workflows (Workflow agents)
- Working in Google Cloud ecosystem

**When to choose OpenAI SDK:**

- Building simple, one-off agents
- Needing maximum flexibility for custom orchestration
- Integrating with non-Google services exclusively
- Team familiar with Python imperative patterns

## Common Setup Issues

**Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.adk'"**

Your environment doesn't have ADK installed. Install it:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

**Issue: "GOOGLE_API_KEY not found" or authentication fails**

Your `.env` file isn't set up or isn't in the right location. Verify:

```bash
cat .env  # Check if file exists and has GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

If missing, create `.env` in your project root (same directory as `agent.py`).

**Issue: "google_search tool not found"**

You're importing from the wrong module. Use:

```python
from google.adk.tools import google_search
```

NOT `from google.genai.tools import ...`

**Issue: adk web doesn't open or shows "Connection refused"**

The web server is running on `localhost:8000` but your browser can't reach it. Try:

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:8000

# If that fails, restart adk web
adk web --port=8001  # Use different port
```

**Issue: Agent takes 30+ seconds to respond**

This is expected. ADK agents:
1. Send your prompt to Google's servers
2. Call google_search tool (which makes HTTP requests)
3. Process search results
4. Generate response

Network latency compounds. This is normal for cloud-based agents.

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Domain-Specific News Agent

```
Create an ADK agent that specializes in researching one specific domain
(choose: climate technology, space exploration, cybersecurity, healthcare AI, or renewable energy).

Write the agent definition with:
- Clear instructions emphasizing the domain focus
- The google_search tool
- Specific constraints (e.g., "only report peer-reviewed sources" or "focus on recent breakthroughs")

Run the agent with: adk run

Ask it: "What's the most significant news in [your domain] this month?"

What does the agent prioritize in its search results? How do the instructions shape its focus?
```

**What you're learning:** How declarative agent specifications drive search behavior and information prioritization

### Prompt 2: Comparing ADK vs OpenAI Pattern

```
Think about an agent you might build: a customer feedback analyzer that researches
company reputation and competitive positioning.

Write the agent definition for ADK:
- Name and instructions
- Tools needed (google_search, maybe others)
- Model choice (explain why)

Then, imagine writing the same agent with OpenAI SDK from Chapter 34.
What would be different?

Specifically consider:
- How would you orchestrate the search (manual loop vs declarative definition)?
- How would you see the agent's reasoning (Events tab vs print statements)?
- How would you deploy it (Vertex AI vs self-hosted)?

Which would you choose for this use case? Why?
```

**What you're learning:** The architectural tradeoffs between declarative (ADK) and imperative (OpenAI) agent design

### Prompt 3: Debugging with adk web

```
Create a simple agent that researches AI news.

Run it with: adk web

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and click the Events tab.

Ask the agent: "What are the latest breakthroughs in AI agent architectures?"

In the Events tab, examine:
1. How many times did google_search get called?
2. What search queries did the agent construct?
3. What results did search return?
4. How did the agent synthesize results into its response?

Compare this visibility to what you'd see with OpenAI SDK (just final_output).
Why is this transparency important for production agents?
```

**What you're learning:** Production agent debugging through declarative tool transparency and reasoning visibility

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `google-adk` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my google-adk skill, create a basic ADK agent with google_search tool.
Does my skill correctly demonstrate LlmAgent creation, model configuration, and tool integration?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include the declarative agent definition pattern (Agent class with name, model, instruction, tools)?
- Did it explain how ADK's Runner pattern differs from OpenAI's imperative SDK approach?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My google-adk skill is missing guidance on declarative agent setup and the Agent class pattern.
Update it to include:
- Agent class instantiation with proper parameters
- Tool registration (both built-in like google_search and custom tools)
- adk run vs adk web usage patterns
- How declarative config separates agent definition from execution
```
