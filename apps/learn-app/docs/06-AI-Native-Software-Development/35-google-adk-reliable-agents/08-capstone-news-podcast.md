# Capstone: AI News Podcast Agent

You've mastered ADK's individual components: agents, custom tools, state management, callbacks, and multi-agent delegation. Now you'll compose them into a complete production system—a News Podcast Agent that autonomously researches emerging technology topics, enriches them with financial context, and generates audio podcasts ready for distribution.

This isn't a toy project. It's a **Digital FTE candidate**—a system you could package, deploy, and sell as a recurring service. Students who need the latest AI news could subscribe; your agent works 24/7 gathering insights, synthesizing context, and producing listening material.

This lesson demonstrates:
- Specification-first architecture (write the system design before code)
- Root coordinator pattern (how agents orchestrate)
- End-to-end workflow from news research → financial analysis → podcast generation
- Production guardrails through callbacks
- Deployment readiness through error resilience

## System Architecture

Your capstone composes five components into a single system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   User Request                              │
│ "Get me the latest AI news"                 │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
               ↓

```

### Component Roles

**Root Agent (Coordinator)**
- Entry point for user requests
- Orchestrates news search, financial enrichment, report generation, podcast creation
- Maintains process log for debugging
- Handles timeouts and partial failures
- Returns complete outcome (report + audio)

**News Agent**
- Specialized in researching recent news
- Uses callbacks to filter out suspicious sources
- Returns structured AINewsReport (topic, summary, sources)
- Decorated with logging for transparency

**Financial Agent**
- Enriches news with market context (stock prices, adoption metrics)
- Integrates yfinance for real data
- Decorated with caching (avoid API rate limits)
- Returns structured financial context

**Report Generator Tool**
- Converts structured data to markdown
- Saves to filesystem with metadata
- Decorated with validation
- Returns file path for downstream use

**Podcaster Agent**
- Generates podcast script from markdown
- Delegates to Gemini TTS for audio generation
- Supports multi-speaker voices (Joe interviewer, Jane expert)
- Returns audio file path + metadata

## Specification (Layer 4 Requirement)

Before implementing, you must write the specification that drives the system design:

```markdown
# AI News Podcast Agent Specification

## Intent
Autonomously research emerging AI topics, enrich with financial context, and generate
audio podcasts for distribution.

## Success Criteria
- User input "topic" → System produces markdown report + MP3 audio file
- Report contains: Topic summary, 3+ sources, key insights, adoption metrics
- Audio: 5-10 minutes, natural voice, conversation-style delivery
- All operations log actions for audit trail
- System continues on partial failures (if audio fails, report still delivered)

## Constraints
- Must filter out non-technical sources (callbacks)
- Max 30 seconds per tool call (timeout)
- No hallucinated data (all numbers from real APIs or clearly marked "estimated")
- Audio generation supports multi-speaker (Joe, Jane voices)

## Composition
1. Root Agent (Coordinator)
   - Receives user topic
   - Orchestrates News + Financial + Report + Podcaster agents
   - Returns combined result

2. News Agent
   - Calls google_search for recent news
   - Filters by domain (must be tech-focused source)
   - Returns: AINewsReport(topic, summary, sources: List[str])

3. Financial Agent
   - Enriches with market data (yfinance)
   - Returns: FinancialContext(adoption_trend, stock_impact, key_metrics)

4. Report Generator (Tool)
   - Converts News + Financial context to markdown
   - Saves file
   - Returns: file_path

5. Podcaster Agent
   - Reads markdown report
   - Generates podcast script
   - Calls TTS with multi-speaker config
   - Returns: audio_file_path

## Output Artifacts
- `reports/[topic]-[timestamp].md` - Markdown report with full context
- `podcasts/[topic]-[timestamp].mp3` - Generated audio
- `logs/process-[timestamp].log` - Complete audit trail

## Non-Goals
- Live streaming podcast
- Multi-language support (English only)
- Scheduled generation (on-demand only)
- Custom voice training
```

This specification describes WHAT the system does without prescribing HOW. Your implementation will follow this contract.

adk deploy agent_engine \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
  --region=${REGION} \
  --staging_bucket="gs://your-staging-bucket" \
  --agent_name="NewsCoordinator"

# Agent becomes accessible via HTTP API
# Call via: POST https://region-agentbuilder.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/agents/NewsCoordinator:run
```

### Option 2: Cloud Run (Cost-Sensitive)

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost for variable workloads
- Simple containerization
- Pay per request

**Deployment:**

Create `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# Start web server exposing API
CMD ["uvicorn", "api:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

Build and deploy:

```bash
gcloud run deploy news-podcast-agent \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 2Gi \
  --timeout 900
```

### Monetization Model

## Production Hardening Checklist

Your capstone works as a demo. Here's what's needed for production:

```python
class ProductionChecklist:
    """
    Elements required to move from capstone to commercial Digital FTE
    """

    SECURITY = [
        "API key rotation every 90 days",
        "Input validation (topic length, character restrictions)",
        "Rate limiting (max 100 requests/hour/user)",
        "Authentication (API keys or OAuth)",
    ]

    RELIABILITY = [
        "Retry logic with exponential backoff",
        "Timeout enforcement (max 30s per tool)",
        "Circuit breaker pattern (detect failing agents)",
        "Dead letter queue for failed requests",
    ]

    MONITORING = [
        "Prometheus metrics (request count, latency, errors)",
        "Cloud Logging integration",
        "Error alerting (PagerDuty or similar)",
        "Dashboard for podcast generation status",
    ]

    DATA_QUALITY = [
        "Fact-checking integration (Factly or similar)",
        "Source validation (whitelist trusted domains)",
        "Duplicate detection (avoid reporting same news twice)",
        "Hallucination detection (verify claims before podcast)",
    ]

    COMPLIANCE = [
        "Privacy: Encrypt API keys, secure logs",
        "Attribution: All sources cited in podcast",
        "Copyright: License music/voice talent appropriately",
        "GDPR: Track user requests, enable deletion",
    ]
```

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Extend to Multiple Topics

**Your Challenge:**

Modify the root coordinator to handle multiple topics in parallel instead of sequentially. Users should be able to request: "Create podcasts for AI agents, ML ops, and generative video."

**Setup:** Start with the complete agent.py coordinator

**Prompt:**
```
"Modify the NewsCoordinator to handle multiple topics in a single request.
When user provides comma-separated topics, create parallel tasks for each.
Use ParallelAgent or concurrent execution to research all topics simultaneously.
All podcasts save to the same output directories with topic names in filenames.

Show how you'd structure the parallel workflow."
```

**Expected:** Architecture showing how parallel topic processing works without blocking

### Prompt 2: Add Audio Quality Validation

**Your Challenge:**

The podcaster agent generates audio, but you have no validation that it meets quality standards (correct duration, no silence, proper speaker transitions). Add a validation tool that checks audio before returning to user.

**Setup:** Reference the podcast generation code

**Prompt:**
```
"Create an audio_validation tool that:
1. Checks audio duration is 5-10 minutes
2. Detects and flags excessive silence (>5 seconds)
3. Validates speaker transitions (Joe/Jane alternate properly)
4. Encodes quality metadata (speaker count, format, bitrate)
5. Returns Pass/Fail with remediation suggestions

Show the tool implementation and how to integrate into postcaster_agent workflow."
```

**Expected:** Validation tool with audio format inspection and quality gates

### Prompt 3: Monetization Implementation

**Your Challenge:**

Your system is production-ready. Now design the subscription API that would allow customers to use it as a service. Show how you'd implement user accounts, rate limiting, billing integration, and podcast delivery.

**Setup:** Think about the complete user experience from signup to podcast delivery

**Prompt:**
```
"Design a subscription API for the News Podcast Agent. Include:
1. User account model (name, email, API key, subscription tier)
2. Rate limiting per tier (Basic: 5 podcasts/month, Pro: 50/month)
3. API endpoint (POST /podcasts/generate with topic parameter)
4. Webhook for async delivery (notify when podcast ready)
5. Stripe integration for billing
6. Show the FastAPI implementation and database schema

Which subscription tiers would you offer and why?"
```

**Expected:** Complete API design showing how to productize the agent as a service
