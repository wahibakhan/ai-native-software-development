# Build Your Apps SDK Skill

Before learning OpenAI's Apps SDK—building ChatGPT Apps with interactive widgets—you'll **own** an Apps SDK skill.

---

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

```bash
cd claude-code-skills-lab
claude
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your Skill

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for OpenAI Apps SDK (ChatGPT
Apps with widgets). I will use it to build interactive ChatGPT Apps from hello
world to professional production systems. Use context7 skill to study official
documentation and then build it so no self assumed knowledge.
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch official OpenAI Apps SDK documentation via Context7
2. Ask you clarifying questions (widget types, interactivity patterns, display modes)
3. Create the complete skill with references and templates

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/openai-apps-sdk/`.

---

## Done

You now own an Apps SDK skill built from official documentation. The rest of this chapter teaches you what it knows—and how to make it better.
