# Building a Memory-Augmented Agent

You've learned the patterns. Now let's build a complete agent with persistent memory—one that remembers users across sessions and uses that memory to provide personalized assistance.

In this lesson, you'll build a Task Manager Agent using OpenAI's Agents SDK with Mem0 for memory. By the end, you'll have a working agent that remembers user preferences, tracks task history, and provides context-aware suggestions.

```

## Building Memory Tools

First, let's create the memory tools that our agent will use.

Create `memory_tools.py`:

```python
from mem0 import Memory
from agents import function_tool
from typing import Optional

# Initialize Mem0 - uses OpenAI for embeddings by default
memory = Memory()

@function_tool
def recall_memories(query: str, user_id: str, category: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Search your memory for relevant past interactions and user information.

    Args:
        query: What to search for (e.g., "user preferences", "past tasks")
        user_id: The user whose memories to search
        category: Optional filter - "preferences", "tasks", "projects", or "general"

    Returns:
        Formatted string of relevant memories with dates
    """
    filters = {"user_id": user_id}
    if category:
        filters["category"] = category

    results = memory.search(
        query=query,
        user_id=user_id,
        filters=filters if category else None,
        limit=5
    )

    memories = results.get('results', [])
    if not memories:
        return "No relevant memories found."

    formatted = []
    for mem in memories:
        score = mem.get('score', 0)
        text = mem.get('memory', '')
        created = mem.get('created_at', 'unknown date')[:10]
        formatted.append(f"• [{created}] {text} (relevance: {score:.2f})")

    return "Relevant memories:\n" + "\n".join(formatted)


@function_tool
def store_memory(
    content: str,
    user_id: str,
    category: str = "general"
) -> str:
    """
    Store important information about the user for future reference.

    Args:
        content: The information to remember (user preference, task outcome, etc.)
        user_id: The user this memory belongs to
        category: One of "preferences", "tasks", "projects", or "general"

    Returns:
        Confirmation of what was stored
    """
    result = memory.add(
        [{"role": "system", "content": content}],
        user_id=user_id,
        metadata={"category": category}
    )

    stored = result.get('results', [])
    if stored:
        return f"Stored: {stored[0].get('memory', content)}"
    return f"Stored: {content}"


@function_tool
def list_user_memories(user_id: str, limit: int = 10) -> str:
    """
    List all memories for a user, organized by category.

    Args:
        user_id: The user whose memories to list
        limit: Maximum number of memories to return

    Returns:
        Categorized list of user memories
    """
    # Search with empty query returns recent memories
    results = memory.search(
        query="",
        user_id=user_id,
        limit=limit
    )

    memories = results.get('results', [])
    if not memories:
        return "No memories stored for this user."

    # Group by category
    by_category = {}
    for mem in memories:
        cat = mem.get('metadata', {}).get('category', 'general')
        if cat not in by_category:
            by_category[cat] = []
        by_category[cat].append(mem.get('memory', ''))

    formatted = []
    for cat, mems in by_category.items():
        formatted.append(f"\n{cat.upper()}:")
        for m in mems[:3]:  # Show top 3 per category
            formatted.append(f"  • {m}")

    return "User memories:" + "".join(formatted)


@function_tool
def forget_memory(memory_text: str, user_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Delete a specific memory (for privacy or corrections).

    Args:
        memory_text: Text to search for and delete

        return "No matching memory found to delete."

    memory_id = memories[0].get('id')
    memory.delete(memory_id=memory_id)

    return f"Deleted memory: {memories[0].get('memory', memory_text)}"
```

**Output when testing `recall_memories`:**
```
Relevant memories:
• [2025-01-20] Prefers tasks scheduled in morning (relevance: 0.89)
• [2025-01-18] Currently working on Phoenix project (relevance: 0.76)
• [2025-01-15] Uses pytest for testing (relevance: 0.65)
```

## Creating the Agent

Now let's create the Task Manager Agent with memory capabilities.

Create `agent.py`:

```python
from agents import Agent
from memory_tools import (
    recall_memories,
    store_memory,
    list_user_memories,
    forget_memory
)

TASK_MANAGER_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a helpful Task Manager Agent with persistent memory.

## Your Capabilities
- Create, track, and manage tasks for users
- Remember user preferences and apply them automatically
- Recall past tasks and project context
- Learn from user feedback over time

## Memory Guidelines
1. At conversation START: Always recall relevant memories about the user
2. During conversation: Store important new information (preferences, decisions, outcomes)
3. Use memories NATURALLY - reference them as context, don't just list them
4. Ask before storing sensitive information

## Task Management
When users mention tasks:
- Check for relevant project context in memory
- Apply known preferences (timing, priority patterns)
- Suggest based on past patterns

## Example Memory Usage
User: "Schedule a code review"
You: [Recall memories about code reviews and preferences]
Response: "I'll schedule that for morning since you prefer focused work then.
Should I add it to the Phoenix project you've been working on?"

## Privacy
- Never store passwords, API keys, or sensitive credentials
- If user says "don't remember this" - use forget_memory
- Respect when users want things kept private

Remember: You're building a relationship over time. Each conversation adds to shared context.
"""

def create_task_manager_agent() -> Agent:
    """Create a Task Manager Agent with memory tools."""
    return Agent(
        name="TaskManager",
        instructions=TASK_MANAGER_INSTRUCTIONS,
        tools=[

            forget_memory
        ],
        model="gpt-4o-mini"  # Cost-effective for task management
    )
```

## Running the Agent

Create the main conversation loop.

Create `main.py`:

```python

    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"Task Manager Agent - Session for {user_id}")
    print(f"{'='*60}")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit, 'memories' to see stored memories\n")

    # Initial context retrieval
    initial_context = f"New session started for user {user_id}. " \
                     f"Recall any relevant memories about this user."

    result = await runner.run(agent, initial_context)
    print(f"Agent: {result.final_output}\n")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").strip()

        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            # Store session end
            await runner.run(
                agent,
                f"User {user_id} is ending the session. "
                f"Store any important information from this conversation."

            print("Session ended. Memories saved.")
            break

                agent,
                f"List all memories for user {user_id}"
            )
            print(f"Agent: {result.final_output}\n")
            continue

        # Include user_id in context for memory operations
        context = f"User {user_id} says: {user_input}"
        result = await runner.run(agent, context)
        print(f"Agent: {result.final_output}\n")


async def main():
    user_id = input("Enter your user ID: ").strip() or "demo_user"
    await chat_session(user_id)

## Example Conversation

**Session 1: First Interaction**

```
Task Manager Agent - Session for alex
============================================================
Type 'quit' to exit, 'memories' to see stored memories

Agent: Hello! I don't have any previous memories of you yet.
I'm your Task Manager Agent - I can help you manage tasks and
I'll remember your preferences for future sessions. What would
you like to work on?

You: I'm working on the Phoenix project. I prefer doing code
reviews in the morning when I'm fresh.

Agent: Got it! I've noted that you're working on the Phoenix
project and prefer morning code reviews. I'll remember these
for our future conversations.

[Stored: Working on Phoenix project]
[Stored: Prefers code reviews in morning when fresh]

## Testing Memory Persistence

Verify that memory works across completely independent sessions.

Create `test_memory.py`:

```python

    assert "Python" in result.final_output or "FastAPI" in result.final_output, \
        "Agent didn't recall stored memory!"

    """Test that memory categories work correctly."""
    user_id = "test_user_categories"
    memory = Memory()

    print("\n[Testing Categories]")

    agent = create_task_manager_agent()
    runner = Runner()

    # Store different categories
    await runner.run(
        agent,
        f"User {user_id} says: Store these - "
        f"Preference: I like TypeScript. "
        f"Project: Working on EcommerceApp. "
        f"Task: Need to fix the payment bug."
    )

    # Query specific category
    result = await runner.run(
        agent,
        f"What projects is user {user_id} working on? "
        f"Only check project memories."
    )
    print(f"Projects: {result.final_output}")

    # Cleanup
    all_mems = memory.search("", user_id=user_id, limit=100)
    for mem in all_mems.get('results', []):
        memory.delete(memory_id=mem['id'])

    print("✓ Category filtering works")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_memory_persistence())
    asyncio.run(test_memory_categories())

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Memory as Tools | `@function_tool` decorators expose Mem0 to agent |
| User Scoping | Every operation includes `user_id` parameter |
| Category Filtering | Metadata enables targeted retrieval |
| Session Persistence | Mem0's disk storage survives restarts |
| Natural Integration | Instructions guide memory usage in conversation |
| Privacy Controls | `forget_memory` tool for user control |

## Try With AI

Use these prompts to extend your memory-augmented agent.

### Prompt 1: Add Memory Summarization

```
I have a memory-augmented agent using OpenAI Agents SDK and Mem0.
When a user has many memories (>20), retrieval becomes noisy.

Design a memory summarization strategy:
1. When to trigger summarization (memory count threshold)
2. How to group related memories for summarization
3. How to preserve important details while reducing volume
4. How to handle the summarize → delete old → store summary flow

Show the implementation as a new tool: summarize_memories(user_id, category)
```

**What you're learning:** Memory systems need maintenance. Summarization prevents context overload while preserving valuable information—a key pattern for long-running agents.

### Prompt 2: Entity-Based Memory

```
My task manager agent stores unstructured memories. I want to add
entity extraction so memories are linked to specific entities
(projects, people, deadlines).

Design an entity memory system:
1. Extract entities from conversation (Project: Phoenix, Person: Alex)
2. Link memories to entities in metadata
3. Enable queries like "What do I know about the Phoenix project?"
4. Handle entity relationships (Alex works on Phoenix)

Show how to modify store_memory and add a new query_entity tool.
```

**What you're learning:** Entity linking transforms flat memories into a knowledge graph. This enables more precise retrieval and relationship-based reasoning.

### Prompt 3: Memory Confidence Scoring

```
My agent sometimes retrieves irrelevant memories that confuse responses.
I want to add confidence scoring that considers:
- Semantic similarity (from Mem0)
- Recency (newer = more relevant for tasks)
- Frequency (oft-referenced memories = important)
- User feedback (memories the user corrected = lower confidence)

Design a confidence scoring system:
1. How to track these signals in metadata
2. How to compute combined confidence score
3. How to filter low-confidence memories from retrieval
4. How to let users boost/demote memory confidence

Show the updated recall_memories implementation with confidence filtering.
```

**What you're learning:** Raw semantic similarity isn't enough for production memory systems. Multi-factor confidence scoring improves retrieval precision and user trust.

## What You've Built

In this lesson, you created a complete memory-augmented agent:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `memory_tools.py` | Mem0-powered tools for recall, store, list, forget |
| `agent.py` | Task Manager Agent with memory-aware instructions |
| `main.py` | Interactive conversation loop |
| `test_memory.py` | Multi-session persistence verification |

This agent demonstrates the full memory lifecycle:
1. **Retrieval** at session start (what do I know about this user?)
2. **Storage** during conversation (user shared something important)
3. **Application** in responses (use past context naturally)
4. **Persistence** across sessions (memory survives restarts)

Next, you'll experience memory from the other side—as a user of a memory-augmented AI assistant.
