# What to Remember and What to Forget

A memory that stores everything is as useless as one that stores nothing. When you ask your agent about a preference, it shouldn't wade through years of irrelevant conversations to find the answer. And when a user says "forget everything about me," the agent must comply—completely and immediately.

Good memory systems are selective. They prioritize what matters, compress what's old, and delete what shouldn't exist. This lesson teaches you how to design those selection mechanisms.

## The Memory Prioritization Problem

Agents interact with users constantly. Every conversation generates potential memories. Without prioritization, you face three problems:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Storage costs** | Memory grows unbounded. Vector databases cost money. |
| **Retrieval noise** | Too many memories = wrong memories retrieved. |
| **Contradiction chaos** | Old information conflicts with new information. |

The solution is **selective memory**—storing what's valuable and actively managing what isn't.

## Relevance Scoring

Not all memories are equally valuable. A relevance scoring system helps prioritize which memories to keep, retrieve, and surface.

### Scoring Factors

Three factors typically influence memory relevance:

**1. Semantic Similarity**
How closely does this memory match the current query?

```
Query: "What are Alex's task preferences?"
Memory A: "Alex prefers morning tasks" → High similarity (0.92)
Memory B: "Alex completed 5 tasks yesterday" → Medium similarity (0.65)
Memory C: "Weather was sunny last Tuesday" → Low similarity (0.12)
```

**2. Recency**
How recently was this memory created or accessed?

```
Memory A: Created 2 days ago → High recency
Memory B: Created 30 days ago → Medium recency
Memory C: Created 1 year ago → Low recency
```

**3. Access Frequency**
How often is this memory retrieved?

```
Memory A: Retrieved 15 times → Frequently accessed
Memory B: Retrieved 3 times → Occasionally accessed
Memory C: Retrieved 0 times → Never accessed
```

### The Scoring Formula

A weighted combination of these factors produces a relevance score:

```python
def calculate_relevance(memory, query, current_time):
    """
    Score = w1 * semantic_similarity
          + w2 * recency_decay
          + w3 * access_frequency

    Weights should sum to 1.0
    """
    # Semantic similarity (0 to 1)
    semantic = cosine_similarity(
        embed(memory.text),
        embed(query)
    )

    # Recency decay (exponential, 0 to 1)
    days_old = (current_time - memory.created_at).days
    recency = math.exp(-days_old / 30)  # Half-life of ~30 days

    # Access frequency (normalized, 0 to 1)
    max_accesses = get_max_access_count()
    frequency = memory.access_count / max_accesses if max_accesses > 0 else 0

    # Weighted combination
    w1, w2, w3 = 0.5, 0.3, 0.2
    return w1 * semantic + w2 * recency + w3 * frequency
```

### Tuning Weights for Use Cases

Different agents need different weight distributions:

| Agent Type | Semantic (w1) | Recency (w2) | Frequency (w3) |
|------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Customer Support | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.1 |
| Personal Assistant | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2 |
| Research Agent | 0.7 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
| Task Manager | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.2 |

A customer support agent cares most about matching the current issue (semantic). A personal assistant cares about recent context (recency). A research agent cares about topic relevance regardless of when it was learned.

## Memory Consolidation

Old detailed memories consume space and add noise. **Consolidation** compresses them into summaries without losing essential information.

### The Consolidation Process

```
BEFORE (10 detailed memories):
├── "Jan 1: Alex created task 'Fix login bug', priority high"
├── "Jan 2: Alex completed 'Fix login bug' in 3 hours"
├── "Jan 3: Alex created task 'Add password reset', priority normal"
├── "Jan 4: Alex completed 'Add password reset' in 2 hours"
├── "Jan 5: Alex created task 'Review PR #45', priority high"
├── "Jan 6: Alex completed 'Review PR #45' in 1 hour"
├── "Jan 7: Alex created task 'Update docs', priority low"
├── "Jan 8: Alex completed 'Update docs' in 4 hours"
├── "Jan 9: Alex created task 'Deploy to staging', priority critical"
└── "Jan 10: Alex completed 'Deploy to staging' in 2 hours"

AFTER (1 consolidated memory):
└── "Week of Jan 1-10: Alex completed 5 tasks averaging 2.4 hours each.
     Priority distribution: 1 critical, 2 high, 1 normal, 1 low.
     Pattern: Tasks consistently completed same day as created."
```

### Consolidation Strategies

**1. Time-based Consolidation**
```
Daily details → Weekly summary → Monthly summary → Yearly summary

Trigger: When memory age exceeds threshold
- After 7 days: Daily → Weekly
- After 30 days: Weekly → Monthly
- After 365 days: Monthly → Yearly
```

**2. Count-based Consolidation**
```
When memories in a category exceed N, consolidate oldest half.

Trigger: Memory count exceeds threshold
- If task_memories > 100: consolidate oldest 50 into summary
```

**3. Importance-based Retention**
```
Never consolidate high-importance memories.
Only consolidate routine, low-value memories.

High value (keep detailed): Decisions, preferences, errors
Low value (consolidate): Routine completions, minor updates
```

### Consolidation Example Code

```python
def consolidate_old_memories(user_id: str, days_threshold: int = 30):
    """Consolidate memories older than threshold into summaries."""
    cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days_threshold)

    # Get old memories
    old_memories = memory.search(
        query="",
        filters={
            "user_id": user_id,
            "created_at": {"lte": cutoff.isoformat()}
        }
    )

    # Group by category
    by_category = group_memories_by_category(old_memories)

    for category, memories in by_category.items():
        if len(memories) < 5:  # Don't consolidate small groups
            continue

        # Generate summary using LLM
        summary = generate_summary(memories)

        # Store summary as new memory
        memory.add([{
            "role": "system",
            "content": f"Consolidated summary of {category}: {summary}"
        }], user_id=user_id, metadata={
            "type": "summary",
            "category": category,
            "consolidated_count": len(memories),
            "date_range": f"{memories[0].created_at} to {memories[-1].created_at}"
        })

        # Delete original detailed memories
        for mem in memories:
            memory.delete(mem.id)
```

## Active Forgetting

Some information must be deleted, not just deprioritized. Active forgetting is a critical capability.

### When to Forget

**1. User Request**
```
User: "Forget that I mentioned my salary."
Agent: Deletes all memories containing salary information.
```

**2. Privacy Compliance (GDPR Article 17)**
The "right to be forgotten" requires complete deletion upon user request:

```python
async def handle_deletion_request(user_id: str):
    """GDPR-compliant complete user deletion."""
    # Get ALL user memories
    all_memories = memory.search(
        query="",
        filters={"user_id": user_id},
        limit=10000  # Get everything
    )

    # Delete each one
    deleted_count = 0
    for mem in all_memories['results']:
        memory.delete(mem['id'])
        deleted_count += 1

    # Audit log (required for compliance)
    log_deletion_event(
        user_id=user_id,
        deleted_count=deleted_count,
        timestamp=datetime.now(),
        reason="user_request_gdpr"
    )

    return {"status": "deleted", "count": deleted_count}
```

**3. Outdated Information**
When new information supersedes old:

```
Old memory: "Alex's phone number is 555-1234"
New statement: "My new phone number is 555-5678"
Action: Delete old memory, store new one
```

**4. Time-based Expiration**
Some memories should auto-expire:

```python
# Store with expiration
memory.add(
    messages,
    user_id=user_id,
    metadata={
        "expires_at": (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=90)).isoformat(),
        "type": "temporary_context"
    }
)

# Cleanup job (run daily)
def cleanup_expired_memories():
    expired = memory.search(
        query="",
        filters={"expires_at": {"lte": datetime.now().isoformat()}}
    )
    for mem in expired['results']:
        memory.delete(mem['id'])
```

### Privacy Requirements Summary

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| User deletion request | Delete all user memories immediately |
| Consent withdrawal | Delete memories created after consent given |
| Purpose limitation | Only store memories for stated purpose |
| Data minimization | Don't store more than necessary |
| Accuracy | Correct or delete inaccurate memories |
| Audit trail | Log all deletions with timestamps |

## Contradiction Resolution

Users change. Preferences evolve. Facts update. Your memory system must handle contradictions gracefully.

### Detection

```python
def detect_contradiction(new_memory: str, existing_memories: list) -> list:
    """Find memories that contradict the new information."""
    contradictions = []

    for existing in existing_memories:
        # Use LLM to detect contradiction
        prompt = f"""
        Existing memory: {existing.content}
        New information: {new_memory}

        Do these contradict each other? If yes, explain how.
        Respond with: CONTRADICTION: [explanation] or NO_CONTRADICTION
        """
        result = llm.generate(prompt)

        if result.startswith("CONTRADICTION"):
            contradictions.append({
                "existing": existing,
                "explanation": result.split(": ", 1)[1]
            })

    return contradictions
```

### Resolution Strategies

**1. Timestamp-based (Newer Wins)**
```python
def resolve_by_timestamp(old_memory, new_memory):
    """Most recent information wins."""
    if new_memory.created_at > old_memory.created_at:
        memory.delete(old_memory.id)
        memory.add(new_memory)
        return "replaced_with_newer"
    return "kept_older"
```

**2. Explicit Update**
```
User: "I'm vegetarian now"
Old memory: "Loves steak dinners"

Agent: "I notice this contradicts an earlier memory about food preferences.
        I'll update my notes to reflect that you're now vegetarian.
        Should I remove all previous food preference memories?"
```

**3. Version History**
```python
def update_with_history(memory_id, new_content):
    """Update memory while preserving history."""
    existing = memory.get(memory_id)

    # Store version history
    history = existing.metadata.get("history", [])
    history.append({
        "content": existing.content,
        "valid_until": datetime.now().isoformat()
    })

    # Update with new content
    memory.update(memory_id, new_content, metadata={
        "history": history,
        "updated_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    })
```

### Example Contradiction Flow

```
Turn 1 (January):
User: "I prefer morning meetings"
→ Store: {"preference": "morning_meetings", "created": "2025-01"}

Turn 2 (March):
User: "Actually, afternoon works better for me now"

Detection:
→ Search finds: "morning meetings" preference
→ LLM identifies: CONTRADICTION

Resolution:
→ Option A: Replace silently (timestamp wins)
→ Option B: Confirm with user (explicit update)
→ Option C: Keep both with dates (version history)

Agent chooses Option A:
→ Delete: "morning meetings" memory
→ Store: "afternoon meetings" preference with March date
→ Reply: "Got it—I've updated my notes. Afternoons from now on."
```

## Safety Note: Memory Privacy

Memory systems handle sensitive personal information. Always implement:

1. **Encryption at rest** — Memories stored in encrypted databases
2. **Access controls** — Only authorized services read memories
3. **Audit logging** — Track all access and modifications
4. **Consent management** — Store proof of user consent
5. **Data minimization** — Don't store what you don't need

## Try With AI

Use these prompts to practice memory prioritization design with Claude or your preferred AI assistant.

### Prompt 1: Design a Relevance Scoring System

```
I'm building an e-commerce customer support agent. Design a relevance scoring system for its memories.

The agent handles:
- Order inquiries
- Return requests
- Product questions
- Shipping issues

For each of these factors, explain how you'd weight them and why:
1. Semantic similarity to current query
2. Recency of the memory
3. Access frequency

Create a scoring formula and show how it would rank these 4 memories when the user asks "Where is my order?":
- Memory A: "Order #123 shipped 2 days ago" (created 2 days ago, accessed 5 times)
- Memory B: "User prefers email updates" (created 30 days ago, accessed 12 times)
- Memory C: "User had delivery issue last month" (created 30 days ago, accessed 3 times)
- Memory D: "User's name is Alex" (created 60 days ago, accessed 20 times)
```

**What you're learning:** How to tune scoring weights for a specific domain. E-commerce support cares heavily about order recency—a 2-day-old shipping memory is gold when the user asks about delivery.

### Prompt 2: Handle Contradictions

```
A user's stated preferences have evolved over time:

Timeline:
- January: "I love steak, it's my favorite food"
- March: "I'm trying to eat less red meat"
- June: "I'm fully vegetarian now"
- September: User asks: "Can you recommend a restaurant for my birthday dinner?"

Questions:
1. How should the agent handle this preference evolution?
2. Should it keep all three memories, or consolidate them?
3. What should it recommend, and how should it reference the user's dietary journey?
4. What if in November the user says "I'm eating meat again"—how does that affect the memory?

Design a contradiction resolution strategy for dietary preferences that handles:
- Gradual evolution
- Explicit reversals
- Temporary vs permanent changes
```

**What you're learning:** Contradictions aren't always "wrong"—sometimes they're evolution. A good memory system captures change over time rather than just keeping the latest value.

### Prompt 3: Consolidation Strategy for Customer Support

```
A customer support agent has accumulated these memories about a user over 6 months:

[15 memories about individual support tickets]
[8 memories about product preferences]
[12 memories about billing inquiries]
[5 memories about feature requests]

Design a consolidation strategy that answers:
1. Which memories should be consolidated and which kept detailed?
2. What triggers consolidation (time? count? both?)
3. What information must the summaries preserve?
4. How do you handle a situation where a consolidated ticket becomes relevant again?

Create example "before and after" for the support ticket category, showing:
- The 15 individual ticket memories
- The consolidated summary
- What was preserved vs. lost
```

**What you're learning:** Consolidation is lossy compression—you choose what to keep. For support tickets, patterns matter more than details: "User has had 3 billing issues" is more useful than 3 separate ticket summaries after 6 months.
