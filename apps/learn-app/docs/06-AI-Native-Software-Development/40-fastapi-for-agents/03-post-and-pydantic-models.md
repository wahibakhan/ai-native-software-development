# POST and Pydantic Models

GET endpoints retrieve data. POST endpoints create data. To create a task, you need to send data in the request body. FastAPI uses Pydantic models to define what that data should look like and validate it automatically.

This matters for agents: when clients send requests to your agent endpoints (Lesson 7), Pydantic ensures the input is valid *before* your agent sees it. Bad data gets rejected at the door, not halfway through an expensive LLM call.

## Why Pydantic Matters for Agents

In Chapter 37, you built MCP servers that validate tool parameters. Pydantic does the same thing for HTTP APIs. When an agent endpoint receives JSON, Pydantic:

1. Parses the raw JSON bytes
2. Validates data types match your model
3. Checks required fields are present
4. Rejects invalid data with helpful error messages

This validation layer is critical when agents compose tools. One agent's output becomes another's input. Type safety at every boundary prevents cascading failures.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None
```

This model says:
- `title` is required and must be a string
- `description` is optional (can be `None`) and defaults to `None`

## How Pydantic Validates (Under the Hood)

When you write `title: str`, Pydantic:

1. **Checks existence** — Is there a "title" key in the JSON? Missing → `Field required` error
2. **Checks type** — Is the value a string? Wrong type → `string_type` error
3. **Attempts coercion** — `"123"` (string) passes. `123` (int) gets coerced to `"123"`
4. **Passes validated data** — Your function receives a guaranteed string

This is why `task.title` in your function is GUARANTEED to be a string. No defensive `if isinstance(title, str)` checks needed.

But what if you need custom validation? Title must be 3-100 characters:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(min_length=3, max_length=100)
    description: str | None = None
```

Now Pydantic enforces length constraints automatically. You'll explore more validation in the exercises.

## Defining Task Models

For our Task API, we need two models:

1. **TaskCreate** — What the client sends when creating a task
2. **TaskResponse** — What the API returns

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

class TaskResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str
    description: str | None
    status: str
```

**Why two models?** The client shouldn't provide `id` or `status`—those are set by the server. Separating models keeps responsibilities clear:

- Client says: "Create a task with this title"
- Server says: "Here's your task with ID 1, status pending"

This separation matters more as your API grows. You might have `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskResponse`, `TaskSummary`—each exposing exactly what that operation needs.

## Creating a POST Endpoint

Add these to your `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="Task API")

# Pydantic models
class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

class TaskResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str
    description: str | None
    status: str

# In-memory storage
tasks: list[dict] = []

@app.post("/tasks", response_model=TaskResponse, status_code=201)
def create_task(task: TaskCreate):
    new_task = {
        "id": len(tasks) + 1,
        "title": task.title,
        "description": task.description,
        "status": "pending"
    }
    tasks.append(new_task)
    return new_task
```

Let's break down the key elements:

- `@app.post("/tasks")` — This endpoint handles POST requests
- `task: TaskCreate` — FastAPI parses the request body as a `TaskCreate` model
- `response_model=TaskResponse` — FastAPI validates the response matches this model
- `status_code=201` — Return 201 Created instead of default 200

## Testing in Swagger UI

Open http://localhost:8000/docs and find the POST endpoint.

1. Click "Try it out"
2. In the request body, enter:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Learn FastAPI",
     "description": "Complete the tutorial"
   }
   ```
3. Click "Execute"

Output:
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
content-type: application/json

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Learn FastAPI",
  "description": "Complete the tutorial",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

The 201 status code confirms the resource was created successfully.

## Validation Errors: What Students Find Confusing

This is where many students get stuck. Let's work through it carefully.

**Try posting with missing title:**

```json
{
  "description": "Missing title"
}
```

Output:
```
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
content-type: application/json

{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "missing",
      "loc": ["body", "title"],
      "msg": "Field required",
      "input": {"description": "Missing title"}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Reading this error:**
- `type: "missing"` — What kind of validation failure
- `loc: ["body", "title"]` — Where the error is: in the body, at field "title"
- `msg: "Field required"` — Human-readable explanation
- `input` — What you actually sent

**Why 422 and not 400?**

This confuses people. Here's the distinction:

- **422 Unprocessable Entity** — The JSON is valid, but data doesn't match the schema. Pydantic catches these.
- **400 Bad Request** — Business logic validation failed (e.g., "title can't be empty whitespace"). You handle these in your code.

FastAPI automatically returns 422 for schema violations. You'll add 400 errors in Lesson 4.

**Try posting with wrong type:**

```json
{
  "title": 123
}
```

Output:
```
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
content-type: application/json

{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "string_type",
      "loc": ["body", "title"],
      "msg": "Input should be a valid string",
      "input": 123
    }
  ]
}
```

Pydantic caught that `title` should be a string, not a number.

## Response Model Filtering

The `response_model` parameter does more than validation—it filters the output. If your internal data has extra fields, only the model's fields are returned.

```python
@app.post("/tasks", response_model=TaskResponse)
def create_task(task: TaskCreate):
    new_task = {
        "id": len(tasks) + 1,
        "title": task.title,
        "description": task.description,
        "status": "pending",
        "internal_flag": True,  # Won't appear in response
        "debug_info": "extra data"  # Neither will this
    }
    tasks.append(new_task)
    return new_task
```

Only `id`, `title`, `description`, and `status` appear in the response because those are the fields in `TaskResponse`. This is a security feature—you won't accidentally leak internal data.

## In-Memory Storage: A Reality Check

We're using a simple list to store tasks:

```python
tasks: list[dict] = []
```

This works for learning but has real limitations:

- **Resets when you restart** — All tasks disappear
- **No persistence** — Nothing saved to disk
- **No concurrency safety** — Two simultaneous requests could corrupt data
- **Single process only** — Multiple workers don't share the list

These aren't problems for learning. They're problems you'll solve with databases in Chapter 47. For now, understand the CRUD pattern—the storage mechanism is secondary.

## Hands-On Exercise

Build the complete task creation flow:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="Task API")

class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

class TaskResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str
    description: str | None
    status: str

tasks: list[dict] = []

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Task API", "task_count": len(tasks)}

@app.post("/tasks", response_model=TaskResponse, status_code=201)
def create_task(task: TaskCreate):
    new_task = {
        "id": len(tasks) + 1,
        "title": task.title,
        "description": task.description,
        "status": "pending"
    }
    tasks.append(new_task)
    return new_task

@app.get("/tasks")
def list_tasks():
    return tasks
```

Test this workflow:
1. POST a task with title "First task"
2. POST another task with title and description
3. GET /tasks to see both tasks
4. GET / to see the task count
5. Try posting without a title and observe the 422 error

## Challenge: Design a Model with Constraints

**Before looking at any solution**, design a model yourself:

**The Problem**: You need a `TaskCreate` model where:
- `title` is required, 3-100 characters
- `description` is optional, max 500 characters
- `priority` is optional, must be "low", "medium", or "high", defaults to "medium"

Think about:
- How do you enforce character limits?
- How do you restrict to specific values?
- What should the error message say if someone sends "urgent" as priority?

Implement it. Then test with intentionally invalid data. Then compare with AI:

> "I designed a TaskCreate model with these constraints: [paste your code]. I used [approach] for the priority field. Does Pydantic have a better pattern for enum-like fields?"

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: Using one model for everything

```python
# Wrong - client shouldn't provide id and status
class Task(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str
    status: str

@app.post("/tasks")
def create_task(task: Task):  # Client must provide id?
    ...
```

Create separate models for input (TaskCreate) and output (TaskResponse).

**Mistake 2**: Forgetting `response_model`

```python
# Without response_model, you might leak internal data
@app.post("/tasks")
def create_task(task: TaskCreate):
    new_task = {..., "password_hash": "secret123"}  # Oops, exposed!
    return new_task
```

Always use `response_model` to control what's returned.

**Mistake 3**: Optional field without default

```python
# Wrong - this makes description required
description: str | None  # No default!

# Correct - union type with default None
description: str | None = None
```

The `= None` is crucial. Without it, the field is required (just nullable).

## Try With AI

Now that you understand Pydantic validation, explore these advanced patterns with AI assistance.

**Prompt 1: Trace the Validation Pipeline**

```text
Trace what happens when I POST this JSON to my FastAPI endpoint:
{"title": 123, "extra_field": "ignored"}

My model is:
class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

Show me each step from raw HTTP request bytes to my function receiving a validated TaskCreate object. What happens to the extra_field? What happens to the integer 123?
```

**What you're learning:** This prompt reveals Pydantic's internals—how it coerces types (123 becomes "123"), ignores extra fields by default, and validates required fields. Understanding this pipeline helps you predict validation behavior and debug unexpected 422 errors.

**Prompt 2: Design a Complex Model**

```text
I need a Pydantic model for creating a Meeting with:
- title: required string, 3-100 characters
- attendees: list of email addresses (must validate email format)
- duration_minutes: must be exactly 15, 30, 60, or 90
- is_recurring: boolean, defaults to false

Show me two implementations: one using Literal and one using Enum for duration_minutes. Which produces better OpenAPI documentation for JavaScript clients?
```

**What you're learning:** This prompt teaches you to evaluate trade-offs in model design. You'll discover that Literal types produce cleaner OpenAPI specs for frontend consumers, while Enums provide better IDE support in Python—a real decision you'll face when designing agent API contracts.

**Prompt 3: Handle Edge Cases**

```text
I want my TaskCreate model to REJECT requests with extra fields instead of ignoring them. I also want custom error messages when validation fails.

Show me how to configure these behaviors in Pydantic v2, and explain when rejecting extra fields is a good idea vs when it causes problems for API evolution.
```

**What you're learning:** This prompt develops your API versioning intuition. Strict validation catches bugs early but makes backward-compatible changes harder. You'll learn to choose the right strictness level for your agent's API lifecycle.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `fastapi-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my fastapi-agent skill, help me create Pydantic models for request and response validation.
Does my skill handle POST endpoints, request body validation, and field constraints?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include Pydantic model patterns (BaseModel, Field constraints)?
- Did it cover separating request models from response models?
- Did it handle validation errors (422 vs 400) appropriately?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My fastapi-agent skill is missing Pydantic validation patterns.
Update it to include request/response model separation, Field constraints,
validation error handling, and the difference between 422 and 400 status codes.
```
