# Build Your FastAPI Skill

Before learning FastAPI—the Python framework for building production APIs—you'll **own** a FastAPI skill.

---

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

```bash
cd claude-code-skills-lab
claude
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your Skill

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for FastAPI. I will use
it to build projects with FastAPI from hello world to professional production
APIs. Use context7 skill to study official documentation and then build it
so no self assumed knowledge.
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch official FastAPI documentation via Context7
2. Ask you clarifying questions (database preferences, auth patterns, deployment target)
3. Create the complete skill with references, templates, and starter code

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/fastapi-dev/`.

## Done

You now own a FastAPI skill built from official documentation. The rest of this chapter teaches you what it knows—and how to make it better.
