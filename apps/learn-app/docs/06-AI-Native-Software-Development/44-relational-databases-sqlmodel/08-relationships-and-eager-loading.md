# Relationships and Eager Loading

Your Task Manager has interconnected data: Tasks belong to Projects, Workers are assigned to Tasks, Tasks can have subtasks. SQLModel models these relationships—but accessing them incorrectly triggers the infamous N+1 problem.

## One-to-Many Relationships

A Project has many Tasks:

```python
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Relationship
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .task import Task

class Project(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str

    # One-to-many: one project has many tasks
    tasks: list["Task"] = Relationship(back_populates="project")
```

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .project import Project

class Task(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    title: str
    project_id: int = Field(foreign_key="project.id", index=True)

    # Many-to-one: many tasks belong to one project
    project: "Project" = Relationship(back_populates="tasks")
```

**Key elements:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `foreign_key="project.id"` | Creates FK constraint in database |
| `Relationship()` | Defines Python-side navigation |
| `back_populates="project"` | Links both sides of relationship |
| `TYPE_CHECKING` | Prevents circular imports |

## Many-to-One with Multiple Foreign Keys

When a model references the same table multiple times, you need `sa_relationship_kwargs`:

```python
class Task(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    title: str

    # Two foreign keys to Worker
    assignee_id: int | None = Field(foreign_key="worker.id", index=True)
    created_by_id: int = Field(foreign_key="worker.id", index=True)

    # Must specify which FK each relationship uses
    assignee: "Worker" = Relationship(
        back_populates="assigned_tasks",
        sa_relationship_kwargs={"foreign_keys": "[Task.assignee_id]"},
    )
    created_by: "Worker" = Relationship(
        back_populates="created_tasks",
        sa_relationship_kwargs={"foreign_keys": "[Task.created_by_id]"},
    )
```

```python
class Worker(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    handle: str  # @john or @researcher

    assigned_tasks: list["Task"] = Relationship(
        back_populates="assignee",
        sa_relationship_kwargs={"foreign_keys": "[Task.assignee_id]"},
    )
    created_tasks: list["Task"] = Relationship(
        back_populates="created_by",
        sa_relationship_kwargs={"foreign_keys": "[Task.created_by_id]"},
    )
```

**Without `foreign_keys`:** SQLAlchemy can't determine which FK to use → error.

## Self-Referential Relationships

Tasks can have parent tasks and subtasks:

```python
class Task(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    title: str
    parent_task_id: int | None = Field(
        default=None,
        foreign_key="task.id",
        index=True,
    )

    # Parent (many-to-one to self)
    parent: "Task" = Relationship(
        back_populates="subtasks",
        sa_relationship_kwargs={
            "remote_side": "Task.id",
            "foreign_keys": "[Task.parent_task_id]",
        },
    )

    # Children (one-to-many from self)
    subtasks: list["Task"] = Relationship(
        back_populates="parent",
        sa_relationship_kwargs={"foreign_keys": "[Task.parent_task_id]"},
    )
```

**Key addition:** `"remote_side": "Task.id"` tells SQLAlchemy which side is the "one" in the one-to-many.

## The N+1 Problem

Watch what happens when you iterate over tasks and access relationships:

```python
# Get all tasks
tasks = (await session.exec(select(Task))).all()

# Access assignee for each task
for task in tasks:
    print(f"{task.title}: {task.assignee.handle}")
```

**What actually happens:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM task;                        -- 1 query
SELECT * FROM worker WHERE id = 1;         -- +1 query
SELECT * FROM worker WHERE id = 2;         -- +1 query
SELECT * FROM worker WHERE id = 1;         -- +1 query (duplicate!)
SELECT * FROM worker WHERE id = 3;         -- +1 query
... (N more queries for N tasks)
```

**For 100 tasks with 50 unique assignees:** 101 queries instead of 2.

This is the **N+1 problem**: 1 query to get tasks, then N queries to get each assignee.

## Eager Loading with selectinload

Load relationships upfront with a single additional query:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import selectinload

stmt = (
    select(Task)
    .options(selectinload(Task.assignee))
)
result = await session.exec(stmt)
tasks = result.unique().all()  # unique() required!

for task in tasks:
    print(f"{task.title}: {task.assignee.handle}")  # No extra queries
```

**What actually happens:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM task;                                    -- 1 query
SELECT * FROM worker WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3, ...);      -- 1 query
```

**For 100 tasks with 50 unique assignees:** 2 queries total.

## Why unique() Is Required

`selectinload` can create duplicate parent objects in results. Always call `unique()`:

```python
# WRONG - may have duplicates
tasks = (await session.exec(stmt)).all()

# CORRECT - deduplicates
tasks = (await session.exec(stmt)).unique().all()
```

## Loading Multiple Relationships

Chain `.options()` for multiple relationships:

```python
stmt = (
    select(Task)
    .options(
        selectinload(Task.assignee),
        selectinload(Task.project),
        selectinload(Task.subtasks),
    )
    .where(Task.project_id == project_id)
)
result = await session.exec(stmt)
tasks = result.unique().all()
```

## Nested Eager Loading

Load relationships of relationships:

```python
# Load tasks → assignee → assigned_tasks (assignee's other tasks)
stmt = (
    select(Task)
    .options(
        selectinload(Task.assignee).selectinload(Worker.assigned_tasks)
    )
)
```

## When to Use Each Strategy

| Relationship Type | Strategy | Why |
|-------------------|----------|-----|
| Many-to-one (task → project) | `selectinload` or `joinedload` | Both efficient |
| One-to-many (project → tasks) | `selectinload` | Avoids row explosion |
| Many-to-many | `selectinload` | Single efficient query |
| Self-referential | `selectinload` | Handles recursion |

**`joinedload` vs `selectinload`:**
- `joinedload`: Uses SQL JOIN, good for single objects
- `selectinload`: Uses separate IN query, better for collections

## Complete Query Pattern

Production query with eager loading:

```python
from sqlmodel import select
from sqlalchemy.orm import selectinload

async def get_project_tasks(
    session: AsyncSession,
    project_id: int,
    include_subtasks: bool = False,
) -> list[Task]:
    stmt = (
        select(Task)
        .options(
            selectinload(Task.assignee),
            selectinload(Task.created_by),
        )
        .where(Task.project_id == project_id)
        .where(Task.deleted_at.is_(None))
        .order_by(Task.created_at.desc())
    )

    if include_subtasks:
        stmt = stmt.options(selectinload(Task.subtasks))

    result = await session.exec(stmt)
    return result.unique().all()
```

**Output (queries logged):**
```
SELECT task.* FROM task WHERE project_id = 1 AND deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY created_at DESC
SELECT worker.* FROM worker WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3)
SELECT worker.* FROM worker WHERE id IN (1, 4)
SELECT task.* FROM task WHERE parent_task_id IN (10, 11, 12)
```

**4 queries total** instead of potentially hundreds.

## Common Mistakes

Database code fails in predictable ways. Learn to recognize and fix these patterns.

### 1. MissingGreenlet Error (Forgetting await)

**Symptom:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenletError: greenlet_spawn has not been called
```

**Cause:** Calling sync method in async context, or missing `await`.

```python
# WRONG - missing await
def get_task(session, task_id):
    return session.get(Task, task_id)  # MissingGreenletError!

# CORRECT - async function with await
async def get_task(session, task_id):
    return await session.get(Task, task_id)
```

**Also common:**
```python
# WRONG - forgot await before exec
result = session.exec(stmt)  # MissingGreenletError!

# CORRECT
result = await session.exec(stmt)
```

### 2. Accessing Relationships Without Loading

**Symptom:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenletError: greenlet_spawn has not been called
```

**Cause:** Accessing lazy-loaded relationship in async context.

```python
# WRONG - triggers lazy load (sync) in async context
task = await session.get(Task, task_id)
print(task.assignee.handle)  # MissingGreenletError!

# CORRECT - eager load first
stmt = select(Task).where(Task.id == task_id).options(
    selectinload(Task.assignee)
)
result = await session.exec(stmt)
task = result.one()
print(task.assignee.handle)  # Works!
```

### 3. Expired Object After Commit

**Symptom:**
```
sqlalchemy.orm.exc.DetachedInstanceError: Instance is not bound to a Session
```

**Cause:** Accessing object after session closed or commit without refresh.

```python
# WRONG - object expired after commit
async def create_task(session, data):
    task = Task(**data)
    session.add(task)
    await session.commit()
    return task  # Object is expired!

# CORRECT - refresh after commit
async def create_task(session, data):
    task = Task(**data)
    session.add(task)
    await session.commit()
    await session.refresh(task)  # Reload from DB
    return task
```

**Or use `expire_on_commit=False`:**
```python
async_session = sessionmaker(
    engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False,  # Objects stay valid after commit
)
```

### 4. Connection Leaks

**Symptom:** Application slows down, then hangs with `QueuePool limit reached`.

**Cause:** Sessions not properly closed.

```python
# WRONG - session never closed
async def get_tasks():
    session = AsyncSession(engine)
    tasks = await session.exec(select(Task))
    return tasks.all()
    # Session leaked! Connection stays open

# CORRECT - context manager ensures cleanup
async def get_tasks():
    async with AsyncSession(engine) as session:
        tasks = await session.exec(select(Task))
        return tasks.all()
    # Session automatically closed
```

### 5. Forgetting unique() with selectinload

**Symptom:** Duplicate items in results.

```python
# WRONG - may return duplicates
stmt = select(Task).options(selectinload(Task.subtasks))
result = await session.exec(stmt)
tasks = result.all()  # Could have duplicate Task objects!

# CORRECT - deduplicate results
tasks = result.unique().all()
```

### 6. N+1 in List Comprehensions

**Symptom:** Slow endpoint, many queries in logs.

```python
# WRONG - N+1 hidden in list comprehension
tasks = (await session.exec(select(Task))).all()
return [{"title": t.title, "assignee": t.assignee.handle} for t in tasks]
# Each t.assignee triggers a new query!

# CORRECT - eager load before comprehension
stmt = select(Task).options(selectinload(Task.assignee))
tasks = (await session.exec(stmt)).unique().all()
return [{"title": t.title, "assignee": t.assignee.handle} for t in tasks]
# All assignees loaded in single query
```

### Quick Reference

| Error | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| `MissingGreenletError` | Missing `await` | Add `await` to async operations |
| `DetachedInstanceError` | Expired object | Use `refresh()` or `expire_on_commit=False` |
| `QueuePool limit reached` | Connection leak | Use `async with` for sessions |
| Duplicate results | Missing `unique()` | Add `result.unique().all()` |
| Slow queries | N+1 pattern | Use `selectinload()` |

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Debug Relationship Error

```
I'm getting this error:
"Could not determine join condition between parent/child tables"

My models:
class Task(SQLModel, table=True):
    assignee_id: int | None = Field(foreign_key="worker.id")
    created_by_id: int = Field(foreign_key="worker.id")
    assignee: "Worker" = Relationship(back_populates="tasks")

class Worker(SQLModel, table=True):
    tasks: list["Task"] = Relationship(back_populates="assignee")

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

**What you're learning:** Multi-FK disambiguation—recognizing when sa_relationship_kwargs is needed.

### Prompt 2: Optimize Query

```
My endpoint is slow. Here's the code:

@router.get("/projects/{project_id}/summary")
async def get_summary(project_id: int, session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session)):
    project = await session.get(Project, project_id)
    return {
        "name": project.name,
        "tasks": [
            {"title": t.title, "assignee": t.assignee.handle}
            for t in project.tasks
        ]
    }

Profile it and show me the optimized version with proper eager loading.
```

**What you're learning:** N+1 optimization—identifying and fixing query performance issues.

### Prompt 3: Recursive Loading

```
My Task model has parent/subtasks for hierarchical tasks.
I need to load a task with all its subtasks, and each subtask's
subtasks (2 levels deep).

Show me the query with nested selectinload and explain
the performance implications of loading deeper levels.
```

**What you're learning:** Recursive relationships—handling tree structures in queries.

### Safety Note

Eager loading loads data you might not need. Balance N+1 prevention with memory usage. For large collections, consider pagination instead of loading everything.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `relational-db-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test its relationship knowledge.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my relational-db-agent skill, generate:
1. A Task model with parent/subtasks self-referential relationship
2. A query that loads tasks with assignee using selectinload
3. Include result.unique().all() pattern
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include `sa_relationship_kwargs` with `remote_side` for parent?
- Did it use `selectinload()` from `sqlalchemy.orm`?
- Did it call `unique()` before `all()`?
- Did it add `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My relational-db-agent skill forgets result.unique().all().
Add this pattern for all selectinload queries:
result = await session.exec(stmt)
items = result.unique().all()  # Always use unique() with selectinload

And add to safety notes: "selectinload can create duplicates - always use unique()"
```

Your skill now prevents N+1 queries correctly.
