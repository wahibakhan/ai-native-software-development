# Transactions and Error Handling

Database transactions ensure your agent's operations succeed completely or fail cleanly. When creating a task with audit logs, either both records exist or neither does.

Getting transactions wrong causes data corruption that's hard to debug.

## flush() vs commit()

These two operations are often confused:

| Operation | What It Does | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `flush()` | Writes to DB but doesn't commit | Need auto-assigned values (IDs) |
| `commit()` | Makes changes permanent | Operation complete, persist data |

```python
async def create_task_with_audit(session: AsyncSession, data: dict):
    # Create task
    task = Task(**data)
    session.add(task)

    # flush() writes to DB - task.id is now available
    await session.flush()
    print(f"Task ID (not yet committed): {task.id}")

    # Use task.id to create audit log
    audit = AuditLog(
        entity_type="task",
        entity_id=task.id,  # Available after flush
        action="created",
    )
    session.add(audit)

    # commit() makes both permanent
    await session.commit()
    print(f"Transaction committed: Task {task.id} and audit log")
```

**Output:**
```
Task ID (not yet committed): 42
Transaction committed: Task 42 and audit log
```

**If you skip flush():**
```python
task = Task(**data)
session.add(task)
# task.id is None here - database hasn't assigned it yet

audit = AuditLog(entity_id=task.id)  # None! Wrong!
```

## Multi-Operation Transactions

Group related operations into a single transaction:

```python
async def create_project_with_tasks(
    session: AsyncSession,
    project_data: dict,
    task_titles: list[str],
) -> Project:
    # Create project
    project = Project(**project_data)
    session.add(project)
    await session.flush()  # Get project.id

    # Create all tasks
    tasks = [
        Task(title=title, project_id=project.id)
        for title in task_titles
    ]
    session.add_all(tasks)

    # Single commit for everything
    await session.commit()
    await session.refresh(project)
    return project
```

**Atomicity guarantee:** If any task fails to insert, the project is also rolled back.

## Rollback on Error

When operations fail, rollback to previous state:

```python
async def safe_create_task(session: AsyncSession, data: dict) -> Task:
    try:
        task = Task(**data)
        session.add(task)
        await session.commit()
        await session.refresh(task)
        return task
    except Exception:
        await session.rollback()
        raise
```

**What rollback does:**
- Discards all uncommitted changes in the session
- Returns connection to pool in clean state
- Prevents partial data from persisting

## Handling IntegrityError

Database constraints raise `IntegrityError`:

```python
from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError
from fastapi import HTTPException

async def create_project(
    session: AsyncSession,
    data: ProjectCreate,
) -> Project:
    try:
        project = Project(**data.model_dump())
        session.add(project)
        await session.commit()
        await session.refresh(project)
        return project
    except IntegrityError as e:
        await session.rollback()
        if "unique constraint" in str(e).lower():
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400,
                detail="Project with this name already exists"
            )
        if "foreign key constraint" in str(e).lower():
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400,
                detail="Referenced record does not exist"
            )
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Database error")
```

**Common IntegrityError causes:**

| Constraint | Example | Response |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Unique | Duplicate email | 400: Already exists |
| Foreign key | Invalid project_id | 400: Parent not found |
| Not null | Missing required field | 400: Field required |

## Context Manager Pattern

Use `async with session.begin()` for automatic commit/rollback:

```python
async def transactional_update(session: AsyncSession):
    async with session.begin():
        # All operations in this block are in one transaction
        task = await session.get(Task, 42)
        task.status = "completed"

        audit = AuditLog(entity_id=42, action="completed")
        session.add(audit)

    # Auto-commit on successful exit
    # Auto-rollback on exception
```

**Benefits:**
- Commit happens automatically on clean exit
- Rollback happens automatically on exception
- No need for try/except/rollback boilerplate

**Caution:** Don't mix with manual `commit()` calls:

```python
# WRONG - double commit
async with session.begin():
    session.add(task)
    await session.commit()  # Error! begin() manages the transaction
```

## Nested Operations

When calling functions that might use the session:

```python
async def outer_operation(session: AsyncSession):
    # Start transaction
    project = Project(name="New Project")
    session.add(project)
    await session.flush()

    # Call inner function - shares the transaction
    await create_initial_tasks(session, project.id)

    # Single commit for everything
    await session.commit()

async def create_initial_tasks(session: AsyncSession, project_id: int):
    # These adds are part of the outer transaction
    tasks = [
        Task(title="Setup", project_id=project_id),
        Task(title="Planning", project_id=project_id),
    ]
    session.add_all(tasks)
    # Don't commit here - outer function handles it
```

## Complete Error Handling Pattern

Production-ready service with error handling:

```python
from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError, SQLAlchemyError
from fastapi import HTTPException
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class TaskService:
    def __init__(self, session: AsyncSession):
        self.session = session

    async def create(self, data: TaskCreate, created_by_id: int) -> Task:
        try:
            task = Task(
                **data.model_dump(),
                created_by_id=created_by_id,
            )
            self.session.add(task)
            await self.session.flush()

            # Create audit log
            audit = AuditLog(
                entity_type="task",
                entity_id=task.id,
                action="created",
                actor_id=created_by_id,
            )
            self.session.add(audit)

            await self.session.commit()
            await self.session.refresh(task)
            return task

        except IntegrityError as e:
            await self.session.rollback()
            logger.warning(f"IntegrityError creating task: {e}")

            if "project_id" in str(e):
                raise HTTPException(400, "Project not found")
            if "created_by_id" in str(e):
                raise HTTPException(400, "Creator not found")
            raise HTTPException(400, "Invalid data")

        except SQLAlchemyError as e:
            await self.session.rollback()
            logger.error(f"Database error creating task: {e}")
            raise HTTPException(500, "Database error")
```

**Output (on FK violation):**
```
WARNING: IntegrityError creating task: insert or update on table "task" violates foreign key constraint
HTTP 400: Project not found
```

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Atomic Bulk Update

```
I need to update all tasks in a project to "archived" status,
and create a single audit log entry for the bulk action.

If any task update fails, I want the entire operation to rollback
including the audit log.

Show me the transactional pattern for this.
```

**What you're learning:** Bulk transaction patterns—ensuring atomicity across multiple records.

### Prompt 2: Retry on Deadlock

```
My agent occasionally gets "deadlock detected" errors when
multiple agents update the same project simultaneously.

Show me a retry pattern that:
1. Catches deadlock errors
2. Retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. Rolls back and re-starts the transaction on each retry
```

**What you're learning:** Concurrency handling—recovering from database contention.

### Prompt 3: Partial Success Handling

```
I'm importing tasks from a CSV. Some rows might have invalid data.
I want to:
1. Insert all valid rows
2. Skip invalid rows
3. Return a report of what succeeded and what failed

Should I use one transaction or many? Show me the pattern.
```

**What you're learning:** Batch processing—balancing atomicity with partial success requirements.

### Safety Note

Never catch exceptions without rollback. A session with uncommitted changes after an error can corrupt subsequent operations. Always rollback in exception handlers.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `relational-db-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test its transaction knowledge.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my relational-db-agent skill, generate a function that:
1. Creates a Project
2. Creates 3 initial Tasks for the project
3. Creates an AuditLog entry
4. Uses flush() to get IDs before commit
5. Rolls back everything if any step fails
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill use `flush()` to get project.id before creating tasks?
- Did it include `try/except` with `rollback()` in the except block?
- Did it handle `IntegrityError` specifically?
- Did it use a single `commit()` at the end?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My relational-db-agent skill doesn't handle IntegrityError.
Add this pattern for all create/update operations:

from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError

try:
    await session.commit()
except IntegrityError:
    await session.rollback()
    raise HTTPException(400, "Constraint violation")
```

Your skill now generates robust transaction patterns.
