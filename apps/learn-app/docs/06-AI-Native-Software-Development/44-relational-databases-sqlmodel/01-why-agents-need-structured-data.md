# Why Agents Need Structured Data

Your Task Manager agent just helped a user create 50 tasks across 5 projects. The user assigned workers, set priorities, added tags. Then the server restarted.

Everything is gone.

This isn't a hypothetical disaster—it's what happens when agents store data only in memory. The moment your process ends, your users lose their work.

## The Persistence Problem

Consider what your Task Manager agent tracks:

| Data | Type | Lifetime |
|------|------|----------|
| Tasks | Structured records | Permanent |
| Projects | Related records | Permanent |
| Worker assignments | Relationships | Permanent |
| Conversation history | Sequential | Session or permanent |
| Search embeddings | Vectors | Permanent |

Memory handles conversation flow during a session. But tasks, projects, assignments—these must survive restarts, scale across instances, and remain consistent when multiple users access them simultaneously.

You need a database.

## Relational vs Vector: Different Questions

You learned about vector databases in Chapter 43. They answer semantic questions:

- "Find tasks similar to 'fix authentication'"
- "What documents discuss deployment?"
- "Show me related concepts"

Relational databases answer structured questions:

- "List all pending tasks for Project X"
- "Who is assigned to Task #42?"
- "How many tasks did each worker complete this week?"

| Question Type | Database | Why |
|---------------|----------|-----|
| "Similar to..." | Vector | Semantic similarity search |
| "Filter by..." | Relational | Exact matching, ordering |
| "Count/sum..." | Relational | Aggregation queries |
| "Related to..." | Both | Depends on relationship type |

Your agent needs both. Vector DB for semantic search. Relational DB for structured queries and persistent state.

## ACID: Why Agents Need Guarantees

When your agent updates the database, things can go wrong. Network drops. Server crashes. Two users edit the same task simultaneously.

ACID properties protect you:

**Atomicity**: All-or-nothing operations. If your agent creates a task with 5 subtasks, either all 6 records exist or none do. No half-created task trees.

```python
# Either both succeed or both fail
async with session.begin():
    session.add(parent_task)
    for subtask in subtasks:
        session.add(subtask)
```

**Consistency**: Rules always hold. If your schema says `project_id` must reference a valid project, the database rejects orphan tasks. Your agent can't accidentally create invalid data.

**Isolation**: Concurrent operations don't conflict. Two agents updating different tasks on the same project don't corrupt each other's work.

**Durability**: Once committed, data survives crashes. Your user's 50 tasks persist through server restarts, power failures, and deployments.

## Why Async Matters for Agents

Your agent does many things:
- Receives user requests
- Calls LLM APIs
- Reads and writes database
- Sends responses

Synchronous database access blocks everything. While waiting for a query, your agent can't process other requests.

```python
# SYNC: Blocks entire process
def get_tasks(project_id):
    return db.query(Task).filter_by(project_id=project_id).all()
    # Nothing else happens until this returns

# ASYNC: Process continues while waiting
async def get_tasks(project_id):
    result = await session.exec(select(Task).where(Task.project_id == project_id))
    return result.all()
    # Other requests processed while waiting
```

Async database access lets your agent:
- Handle multiple concurrent users
- Process API responses while queries run
- Scale to production workloads

This is why we use `create_async_engine` and `AsyncSession` exclusively in this chapter.

## The Task Manager Data Model

Throughout this chapter, you'll build a database layer for the Task Manager:

```
Project
  └── Task (many)
       ├── Worker (assigned)
       ├── Worker (created_by)
       └── Task (subtasks - self-referential)
```

This structure exercises:
- One-to-many relationships (Project → Tasks)
- Many-to-one with multiple foreign keys (Task → Worker for two purposes)
- Self-referential relationships (Task → parent/subtasks)
- JSONB columns (tags, metadata)

By chapter end, you'll have a complete async database layer matching production patterns.

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Classify Your Data

```
I'm building an AI agent that manages customer support tickets.
It tracks:
- Ticket records with status, priority, assignee
- Customer information
- Similar past tickets for context
- Conversation history with customers

For each data type, recommend: relational database, vector database,
or both? Explain your reasoning based on how the data will be queried.
```

**What you're learning:** Database selection based on query patterns—matching data characteristics to appropriate storage.

### Prompt 2: Design for Reliability

```
My agent creates a Project with 10 Tasks in a single user request.
What ACID property ensures that if task #7 fails to save,
the entire operation rolls back including the Project and tasks 1-6?

Show me the Python code pattern that implements this guarantee
using SQLModel's async session.
```

**What you're learning:** Atomicity in practice—understanding how transactions protect data integrity.

### Prompt 3: Justify Async

```
My agent currently uses synchronous database access and handles
about 10 requests per second. I want to scale to 100 requests
per second without adding more servers.

Explain how async database access helps, and what changes
I need to make to my SQLModel code to achieve this.
```

**What you're learning:** Async performance reasoning—understanding why async matters for scale.

### Safety Note

Database operations can fail. Always handle connection errors, query timeouts, and constraint violations. Your agent should gracefully inform users when database issues occur rather than crashing silently.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `relational-db-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test its understanding of these concepts.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my relational-db-agent skill, explain when I should
use a relational database vs a vector database for my agent.
Give me a decision framework.
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill distinguish structured queries from semantic search?
- Did it mention ACID properties?
- Did it recommend async patterns?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My relational-db-agent skill doesn't explain when to use
relational vs vector databases. Add guidance that:
- Relational: exact matching, filtering, aggregation, relationships
- Vector: semantic similarity, fuzzy matching, context retrieval
- Often use both in agent architectures
```

Your skill now helps you make better architectural decisions.
