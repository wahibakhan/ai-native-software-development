# What Is an AI Agent?

You've been using an AI agent for months. Claude Code reasons about your requests, uses tools, observes results, and iterates until it succeeds. That's not how ChatGPT works. This lesson explains what makes Claude Code different—and why that difference matters.

## The Definition

An AI agent uses a language model **in a loop** to accomplish a goal:

1. **Reason** about what to do
2. **Act** using tools
3. **Observe** the result
4. **Repeat** until done

ChatGPT responds once. Claude Code loops until your task is complete. That loop is what makes something an agent.

When you ask Claude Code to "refactor this code and verify it works," it:
- Reads code (observes)
- Plans refactoring approach (reasons)
- Writes new code (acts)
- Runs tests (observes)
- Fixes failures (loops)

You didn't specify those steps. The agent reasoned through them autonomously.

## The 5-Level Taxonomy

Not all agents are equal. The taxonomy classifies systems by autonomy:

| Level | Name | Who Controls Strategy? | Example |
|-------|------|----------------------|---------|
| 0 | Core Reasoning | No one (single response) | ChatGPT without tools |
| 1 | Connected | Human drives each step | ChatGPT with web search |
| 2 | Strategic | System plans multi-step | Claude Code on a refactor |
| 3 | Multi-Agent | System coordinates specialists | Code + test + docs agents |
| 4 | Self-Evolving | System creates new tools | Agent builds custom analyzers |

**Level 0**: Model responds once. No tools, no loop.

**Level 1**: Model uses tools, but you drive the strategy. "Search for X" → results → you decide next step.

**Level 2**: Model plans and executes multi-step strategies. You set the goal; it figures out how. Claude Code typically operates here.

**Level 3**: Multiple specialized agents coordinate. A code agent, test agent, and docs agent work together. Claude Code does this on complex tasks.

**Level 4**: The system creates new capabilities to solve novel problems. Rare today.

### Where Claude Code Fits

Claude Code is Level 2-3 depending on the task:

**Level 2 example**: "Debug this error."
- Asks clarifying questions
- Requests logs and code
- Reasons through causes
- Suggests and tests fixes
- Iterates until solved

**Level 3 example**: "Audit this codebase for security, performance, and correctness."
- Security specialist examines auth and data handling
- Performance analyst checks bottlenecks
- Quality agent reviews tests and docs
- Coordinator synthesizes findings

You experience one interface. Behind it, multiple perspectives coordinate.

## Director vs Bricklayer

The paradigm shift that matters:

**Bricklayer** (traditional): You specify every step. "Read file X, parse format Y, handle error Z." You're the executor.

**Director** (agent era): You specify intent and constraints. "Extract structured data from these documents. Ensure quality." The agent reasons about how.

| Bricklayer | Director |
|------------|----------|
| "Write validation with these exact checks" | "Validate input securely" |
| "Call API A, retry 3 times on timeout" | "Fetch data reliably" |
| "Parse JSON, extract fields X, Y, Z" | "Get the relevant information" |

Director-level thinking is harder. You must articulate intent clearly, anticipate failure modes, and trust the system to reason. But it's more powerful—agents adapt to situations you didn't anticipate.

This is why specification skills (from Part 4) become critical. Vague goals create unreliable agents. Precise specifications create predictable systems.

## Why This Matters

Agent development skills are scarce. Most developers can *use* ChatGPT. Few can *design* agent systems that work reliably.

The gap: Companies need people who can specify agent behavior precisely, debug agent reasoning, and decide when to use agents vs traditional code. That's what Chapters 34-36 teach.

## The Strategic Choice: General Agents vs Custom Agents

Beyond taxonomy, there's a strategic decision every AI builder faces: **General Agents** vs **Custom Agents**.

### General Agents

Ready-to-use AI partners that reason across many domains. Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Goose are General Agents.

**Characteristics:**
- Flexible reasoning across diverse problems
- Zero-shot planning (figure out novel situations)
- Human-in-the-loop collaboration
- Instant deployment (install and run)

**Best for:** Novel problems, complex debugging, ad-hoc analysis, creative work, exploration

**Analogy:** Hiring a senior consultant who figures things out

### Custom Agents

Purpose-built AI systems you design using SDKs (OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude SDK, Google ADK).

**Characteristics:**
- Optimized for specific workflows
- Guardrails and process control
- Deterministic, repeatable behavior
- Customer-facing reliability

**Best for:** Standardized procedures, high-volume automation, customer-facing products, SOPs

**Analogy:** Building a factory machine for a specific task

### The Decision Matrix

| Factor | Choose General Agent | Choose Custom Agent |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Task type | Novel, varied | Repetitive, standardized |
| End user | Technical (developers) | Non-technical (customers) |
| Error tolerance | High (human reviews) | Low (must be reliable) |
| Cost model | High value per task | Volume optimization |
| Time to deploy | Minutes | Weeks |

### The Agent Factory Insight

Here's the paradigm shift: **General Agents build Custom Agents**.

Claude Code (a General Agent) can:
1. Read your specification
2. Understand the SDK documentation
3. Generate Custom Agent code
4. Test and iterate until it works

You don't choose between General and Custom—you use General Agents to *create* Custom Agents. This is the "Agent Factory" model.

**Your expertise + General Agent + SDK = Deployable Custom Agent**

Skills you create in Claude Code (Chapter 5) become the building blocks—reusable intelligence packaged in SKILL.md files that teach agents specialized workflows. These skills are monetizable IP: the "recipe" for your agent's expertise. In Chapters 34-36, you'll use Claude Code to build Custom Agents with OpenAI, Claude, and Google SDKs.

### The Business Angle

Custom Agents aren't just technical artifacts—they're **products you can sell**.

In Chapter 5 Lesson 14, you learned about the Digital FTE model: packaging AI agents as "virtual employees" with monthly subscriptions. The agents you build in this chapter are the technical foundation for that business model.

| What You Build | How It Makes Money |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Customer support agent | Digital FTE: $1,000/month subscription |
| Document review agent | Success fee: $5 per document processed |
| Lead qualification agent | License: $50,000/year to enterprises |
| Data analysis agent | Marketplace: Publish to OpenAI Apps |

The technical skills in Chapters 34-36 directly translate to revenue. Every agent you learn to build is a potential product.

## Try With AI

Use Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini to practice classification.

> "A bank chatbot asks for my account number to check my balance. What level in the 5-Level Taxonomy? Why not higher?"

**Expected**: Level 1—has tools but humans drive strategy.

> "When Claude Code refactors a 500-line file and improves test coverage, describe its reason-act-observe loop. What level?"

**Expected**: Level 2-3—it plans strategy, executes multi-step, may coordinate specialists.

> "I tell an agent 'validate user input securely' vs 'write these exact validation checks.' Which is director thinking? Why is it harder but more powerful?"

**Expected**: First is director. Harder because you must specify intent precisely. More powerful because the agent adapts.

**Key insight**: The level isn't about sophistication of tools—it's about who controls the reasoning loop.

> "A startup wants to automate customer onboarding emails. Should they use Claude Code (General Agent) or build a Custom Agent with OpenAI SDK? What factors drive that decision?"

**Expected**: Custom Agent—standardized workflow, customer-facing, needs reliability. But they'd use Claude Code to *build* the Custom Agent.

> "Explain the 'Agent Factory' concept. Why don't you choose between General and Custom Agents?"

**Expected**: General Agents build Custom Agents. You use Claude Code to create purpose-built agents with SDKs. They're complementary, not competing.
