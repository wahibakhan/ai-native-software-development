# Part 8: Turing LLMOps — Proprietary Intelligence

Parts 1-7 taught you to build, deploy, and operate AI agents with foundation models. Part 8 teaches when to go further—creating **proprietary intelligence** through managed fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment on the Turing platform. You shift from consuming models to producing differentiated ones.

---

## Goals

By completing Part 8, you will:

- **Decide when to fine-tune** vs. improve prompting or model selection
- **Prepare high-quality datasets** with quality and safety gates
- **Run managed training** workflows with checkpoints and rollback
- **Evaluate rigorously** using task-specific metrics and acceptance thresholds
- **Deploy production endpoints** with versioning, traffic controls, and monitoring
- **Integrate custom models** with your agent stack (MCP, SDKs, FastAPI, Kubernetes)

## Chapter Progression

Four stages guide the LLMOps lifecycle end-to-end:

- **Concepts & Setup (61-62)**: LLMOps fundamentals, economics, decision frameworks, and Turing platform onboarding.
- **Data & Training (63-66)**: Data pipelines, supervised fine-tuning, persona tuning, and agentic function calling.
- **Optimization & Safety (67-69)**: Model merging, performance tuning, alignment practices, and evaluation quality gates.
- **Deployment & Integration (70-72)**: Serving custom models, integrating with agent frameworks, and capstone end-to-end LLMOps delivery.

**Why this order?** Strategic decisions come first, then data quality, then optimization and safety, and finally production deployment with integrations back into your existing systems.

## Outcome & Method

You finish Part 8 able to decide whether custom models are worth the investment and, when they are, execute the full lifecycle from data to deployment. The same spec-driven approach continues: write training/evaluation specs, let AI draft pipelines, and verify against objective success metrics.
