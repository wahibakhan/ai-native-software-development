# Velero for Kubernetes Backup and Restore

It happens faster than you can react. A junior developer runs `kubectl delete namespace production` instead of `kubectl delete namespace test-production`. In the two seconds before muscle memory kicks in and they hit Ctrl+C, Kubernetes has already begun terminating every pod, service, configmap, and secret in your production namespace.

Your database PersistentVolumeClaim survives because the storage class has `reclaimPolicy: Retain`. Small mercy. But the Task API deployment, the inference service configuration, the carefully-tuned HPA settings, the secrets containing API keys for three external services - all gone. You stare at the terminal, trying to remember what was in that namespace. You haven't touched some of those configurations in months.

This is the moment you discover whether your disaster recovery strategy exists beyond good intentions. Do you have backups? When were they last tested? Can you restore to a specific namespace? How long until production is back?

Velero answers these questions before disaster strikes. It's a CNCF project that backs up Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes, stores them safely off-cluster, and restores them when you need them. This lesson teaches you to install Velero, configure scheduled backups with retention policies, implement database-aware hooks for consistency, and verify that restores actually work.

## Installing Velero with MinIO for Local Development

In production, you'll use cloud object storage - S3, GCS, Azure Blob. For local development and testing, MinIO provides an S3-compatible storage backend that runs in your cluster.

**Step 1: Deploy MinIO**

```bash
helm repo add minio https://charts.min.io/
helm install minio minio/minio \
  --namespace minio \
  --create-namespace \
  --set rootUser=minioadmin \
  --set rootPassword=minioadmin \
  --set mode=standalone \
  --set resources.requests.memory=512Mi \
  --set persistence.size=10Gi
```

**Output:**

```
NAME: minio
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 30 10:00:00 2024
NAMESPACE: minio
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```

Create a bucket for Velero backups:

```bash
kubectl run minio-client --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=minio/mc \
  --namespace=minio \
  --command -- /bin/sh -c "
    mc alias set myminio http://minio:9000 minioadmin minioadmin && \
    mc mb myminio/velero-backups
  "
```

**Output:**

```
Bucket created successfully 'myminio/velero-backups'.
pod "minio-client" deleted
```

**Step 2: Install Velero**

```bash
helm repo add vmware-tanzu https://vmware-tanzu.github.io/helm-charts
helm install velero vmware-tanzu/velero \
  --namespace velero \
  --create-namespace \
  --set configuration.backupStorageLocation[0].name=default \
  --set configuration.backupStorageLocation[0].provider=aws \
  --set configuration.backupStorageLocation[0].bucket=velero-backups \
  --set configuration.backupStorageLocation[0].config.region=minio \
  --set configuration.backupStorageLocation[0].config.s3ForcePathStyle=true \
  --set configuration.backupStorageLocation[0].config.s3Url=http://minio.minio:9000 \
  --set snapshotsEnabled=false \
  --set initContainers[0].name=velero-plugin-for-aws \
  --set initContainers[0].image=velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.10.0 \
  --set initContainers[0].volumeMounts[0].mountPath=/target \
  --set initContainers[0].volumeMounts[0].name=plugins \
  --set credentials.useSecret=true \
  --set credentials.secretContents.cloud='[default]\naws_access_key_id=minioadmin\naws_secret_access_key=minioadmin'
```

**Output:**

```
NAME: velero
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 30 10:05:00 2024
NAMESPACE: velero
STATUS: deployed
```

Verify Velero is running and connected to storage:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n velero
kubectl get backupstoragelocation -n velero
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
velero-7c4b5d9f8d-x2k9m   1/1     Running   0          60s

NAME      PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
default   Available   30s              60s   true
```

The `Available` phase confirms Velero can reach the MinIO bucket.

## Understanding Velero's CRD Architecture

Velero introduces four Custom Resource Definitions that work together to manage backups and restores.

### BackupStorageLocation: Where Backups Live

The BackupStorageLocation tells Velero where to store backup data. You configured this during installation, but you can have multiple locations for different purposes:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: BackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: secondary-location
  namespace: velero
spec:
  provider: aws
  objectStorage:
    bucket: velero-backups-secondary
  config:
    region: us-east-1
    s3Url: https://s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Backup: A Point-in-Time Snapshot

A Backup captures Kubernetes resources at a specific moment. You can create on-demand backups:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: production-backup-2024-12-30
  namespace: velero
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
    - production
  includedResources:
    - deployments
    - services
    - configmaps
    - secrets
    - persistentvolumeclaims
  excludedResources:
    - events
    - pods
  ttl: 720h  # 30 days
```

**Key fields:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `includedNamespaces` | Which namespaces to back up |
| `includedResources` | Which resource types to include (defaults to all) |
| `excludedResources` | Skip ephemeral resources like pods and events |
| `ttl` | How long to keep this backup before automatic deletion |

### Schedule: Automated Recurring Backups

A Schedule creates Backups automatically based on a cron expression. This is what you'll use for production:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: task-api-daily
  namespace: velero
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM daily
  template:
    includedNamespaces:
      - production
    snapshotVolumes: true
    ttl: 720h  # 30-day retention
```

The `template` section contains everything that would go in a Backup spec. Velero creates a new Backup from this template on the defined schedule.

### Restore: Recovering from Backup

A Restore brings resources back from a specific Backup:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-from-production-backup
  namespace: velero
spec:
  backupName: production-backup-2024-12-30
  includedNamespaces:
    - production
  restorePVs: true
```

You can restore to the same namespace (recovery) or a different namespace (cloning).

## Creating a Production Schedule with 30-Day Retention

The RTO/RPO lesson established your recovery requirements. Now you'll implement them with a Velero Schedule. A 24-hour RPO means daily backups; 30-day retention means you can recover from problems that weren't noticed immediately.

Create the Schedule manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: task-api-production-daily
  namespace: velero
  labels:
    app: task-api
    environment: production
    backup-type: scheduled
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM UTC daily
  useOwnerReferencesInBackup: false
  template:
    includedNamespaces:
      - production
    includedResources:
      - "*"
    excludedResources:
      - events
      - pods
      - replicasets
    snapshotVolumes: true
    storageLocation: default
    volumeSnapshotLocations:
      - default
    ttl: 720h  # 30 days = 720 hours
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
        backup-type: daily
```

Apply the Schedule:

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-schedule.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
schedule.velero.io/task-api-production-daily created
```

Verify the Schedule:

```bash
velero schedule describe task-api-production-daily
```

**Output:**

```
Name:         task-api-production-daily
Namespace:    velero
Labels:       app=task-api
              backup-type=scheduled
              environment=production
Phase:        Enabled
Schedule:     0 2 * * *
TTL:          720h0m0s

Backup Template:
  Namespaces:
    Included:  production
  Resources:
    Included:        *
    Excluded:        events, pods, replicasets
  Snapshot PVs:      true
  Storage Location:  default
```

### Understanding TTL Retention

The `ttl: 720h` field means backups expire 30 days after creation. Velero automatically deletes expired backups and their associated data in object storage. This prevents backup storage from growing unbounded.

| TTL Value | Retention Period |
|-----------|------------------|
| `168h` | 7 days |
| `336h` | 14 days |
| `720h` | 30 days |
| `2160h` | 90 days |
| `8760h` | 1 year |

Match your TTL to your compliance and recovery requirements. Longer retention uses more storage but lets you recover from problems discovered weeks later.

## Implementing Backup Hooks for Database Consistency

Regular Kubernetes resource backups capture YAML manifests. But databases need special handling. If Velero backs up a PostgreSQL PersistentVolumeClaim while the database is actively writing, the backup might contain inconsistent data - half-written transactions, incomplete indexes.

Backup hooks solve this by running commands in containers before and after the backup:

- **Pre-backup hook**: Quiesce the database (stop writes, flush to disk)
- **Post-backup hook**: Resume normal operations

### Complete Schedule with Database Hooks

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: task-api-production-daily
  namespace: velero
  labels:
    app: task-api
    environment: production
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  template:
    includedNamespaces:
      - production
    includedResources:
      - "*"
    excludedResources:
      - events
      - pods
      - replicasets
    snapshotVolumes: true
    ttl: 720h
    hooks:
      resources:
        - name: postgres-consistency
          includedNamespaces:
            - production
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: postgres
          pre:
            - exec:
                container: postgres
                command:
                  - /bin/bash
                  - -c
                  - |
                    echo "Starting pre-backup hook at $(date)"
                    # Create a checkpoint to flush WAL to disk
                    psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "CHECKPOINT;"
                    # Dump database for application-level recovery
                    pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" > /var/lib/postgresql/data/backup.sql
                    echo "Pre-backup hook completed at $(date)"
                onError: Fail
                timeout: 120s
          post:
            - exec:
                container: postgres
                command:
                  - /bin/bash
                  - -c
                  - |
                    echo "Post-backup hook completed at $(date)"
                    # Remove temporary dump file
                    rm -f /var/lib/postgresql/data/backup.sql
                onError: Continue
                timeout: 30s
```

### Hook Configuration Explained

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `labelSelector` | Which pods the hook applies to |
| `pre.exec.container` | Which container in the pod to run the command |
| `pre.exec.command` | The command to execute |
| `onError: Fail` | Abort the backup if the hook fails |
| `onError: Continue` | Proceed even if hook fails (for non-critical post-backup cleanup) |
| `timeout` | Maximum time to wait for hook completion |

### Why Pre-Backup Hooks Matter

Without the hook, Velero might capture the PersistentVolumeClaim while PostgreSQL is mid-transaction. The `CHECKPOINT` command forces PostgreSQL to write all dirty buffers to disk, ensuring the volume snapshot is consistent.

The `pg_dump` creates an additional SQL backup inside the container. This provides application-level recovery - you can restore the logical dump even if the volume snapshot has issues.

## Restore Procedure: Step-by-Step Recovery

When disaster strikes, you need a reliable, tested restore procedure. Here's the complete workflow:

### Step 1: Verify Available Backups

```bash
velero backup get
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                                       STATUS      ERRORS   WARNINGS   CREATED                          EXPIRES
task-api-production-daily-20241230020000   Completed   0        0          2024-12-30 02:00:00 +0000 UTC    29d
task-api-production-daily-20241229020000   Completed   0        0          2024-12-29 02:00:00 +0000 UTC    28d
task-api-production-daily-20241228020000   Completed   0        0          2024-12-28 02:00:00 +0000 UTC    27d
```

### Step 2: Inspect a Specific Backup

```bash
velero backup describe task-api-production-daily-20241230020000 --details
```

**Output:**

```
Name:         task-api-production-daily-20241230020000
Namespace:    velero
Phase:        Completed

Namespaces:
  Included:  production

Resources:
  Included:        *
  Excluded:        events, pods, replicasets

Backup Hooks:
  Resources:
    Name:  postgres-consistency
    Pre Exec Hook:
      Container:  postgres
      Command:    /bin/bash -c echo "Starting pre-backup hook..."
      On Error:   Fail
      Timeout:    2m0s
    Post Exec Hook:
      Container:  postgres
      Command:    /bin/bash -c echo "Post-backup hook completed..."
      On Error:   Continue
      Timeout:    30s
```

### Step 3: Create a Restore

```bash
velero restore create restore-production-20241230 \
  --from-backup task-api-production-daily-20241230020000 \
  --include-namespaces production \
  --restore-volumes=true
```

**Output:**

```
Restore request "restore-production-20241230" submitted successfully.
Run `velero restore describe restore-production-20241230` for more details.
```

### Step 4: Monitor Restore Progress

```bash
velero restore describe restore-production-20241230 --details
```

**Output:**

```
Name:         restore-production-20241230
Namespace:    velero
Phase:        InProgress

Restore Volumes:
  task-api-pvc:  InProgress
  postgres-pvc:  InProgress
```

Wait for completion:

```bash
velero restore wait restore-production-20241230
```

**Output:**

```
Restore completed with status: Completed. Duration: 2m30s.
```

### Step 5: Verify the Restore

Check that resources are restored:

```bash
kubectl get deployments -n production
kubectl get services -n production
kubectl get pvc -n production
```

**Output:**

```
NAME        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
task-api    3/3     3            3
postgres    1/1     1            1

NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    PORT(S)
task-api    ClusterIP   10.96.x.x     8000/TCP
postgres    ClusterIP   10.96.x.x     5432/TCP

NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY
task-api-pvc    Bound    pvc-abc123...                             5Gi
postgres-pvc    Bound    pvc-def456...                             10Gi
```

### Step 6: Validate Application Functionality

```bash
# Port-forward to test the API
kubectl port-forward svc/task-api 8000:8000 -n production &

# Test the API endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Output:**

```
{"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}
```

## Discovering Backup Patterns Through Collaboration

You've learned to install Velero, configure scheduled backups, and implement hooks. But backup strategies aren't one-size-fits-all. Your specific requirements - compliance constraints, database types, multi-cluster architecture - shape the patterns you need.

**Your initial approach:**

You've set up a daily backup with 30-day retention and PostgreSQL hooks. But you're wondering: "Is this enough for production? What am I missing?"

**Exploring hook timing with AI:**

```
I have a Velero Schedule with pre-backup hooks that run pg_dump before backing up my PostgreSQL PVC.
The hook has a 120-second timeout. My database has grown to 50GB.

Questions:
1. Will pg_dump complete in 120 seconds for a 50GB database?
2. Should I increase the timeout, or is there a better approach?
3. What happens to the backup if the hook times out?
```

AI responds with insight you hadn't considered: "For a 50GB database, pg_dump might take 5-10 minutes depending on I/O speed. Consider using `pg_basebackup` for larger databases, or PostgreSQL's native WAL archiving. The timeout should be 600s minimum. If the hook times out with `onError: Fail`, the entire backup fails - which is what you want for data consistency."

**You refine based on this feedback:**

"That makes sense. But my RPO is 24 hours - I can tolerate some data loss. Should I switch to `onError: Continue` so backups don't fail entirely if the hook times out?"

AI adapts to your constraint: "For a 24-hour RPO, that's a reasonable trade-off. You'd have a backup without the SQL dump, but the PVC snapshot would still exist. However, consider: if the hook consistently times out, you're not getting application-consistent backups at all. Better solution: increase timeout AND set up alerting on hook failures."

**What emerged from this iteration:**

A more sophisticated backup strategy:
- Increased hook timeout to 600 seconds
- Added monitoring for hook execution time
- Configured alerts when hooks take longer than 300 seconds (warning threshold)
- Kept `onError: Fail` to guarantee consistency, but added fallback alerting

Neither you nor AI had this complete picture initially. You knew your RPO; AI knew PostgreSQL backup patterns. Together, you designed a robust solution.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built an `operational-excellence` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned about Velero.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my operational-excellence skill, generate a Velero Schedule for the
task-api application with the following requirements:
- Daily backups at 3 AM UTC
- 30-day retention
- Pre-backup hook that runs pg_dump on the postgres container
- Back up only the production namespace
- Exclude events, pods, and replicasets
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include the complete hook syntax with `onError` and `timeout`?
- Did it explain when to use `onError: Fail` vs `onError: Continue`?
- Did it include the TTL calculation (720h = 30 days)?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My operational-excellence skill generated the Schedule but didn't include
the `timeout` field for hooks. Update it to always include:
- timeout: 120s minimum for pre-backup hooks
- onError: Fail for data-consistency hooks
- onError: Continue for non-critical cleanup hooks

Also add guidance on TTL values:
- 168h = 7 days
- 720h = 30 days
- 2160h = 90 days
```

## Try With AI

These prompts help you apply Velero patterns to your own backup requirements.

**Prompt 1: Backup Strategy Design**

```
I'm designing a backup strategy for my Kubernetes cluster running three applications:
- Task API (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- Inference Service (stateless, connects to external LLM APIs)
- Redis cache (ephemeral, can be rebuilt)

Help me decide:
1. Which components need Velero backups vs just Helm charts for reconstruction?
2. What backup frequency for each?
3. Which need database hooks and which don't?
```

**What you're learning:** Not everything needs the same backup strategy. Stateless services can often be reconstructed from Helm charts and container images faster than restoring from backup. AI helps you distinguish between data that needs backup (PostgreSQL) and infrastructure that can be rebuilt (Redis, stateless APIs).

**Prompt 2: Multi-Cluster Backup Architecture**

```
I have three Kubernetes clusters: dev, staging, production. I want to:
- Back up production daily to cloud storage
- Be able to restore production to staging for debugging
- Keep 7-day retention in dev, 30-day in staging, 90-day in production

Design the BackupStorageLocation and Schedule configuration for this setup.
What are the implications of cross-cluster restore?
```

**What you're learning:** Enterprise backup patterns involve multiple storage locations and retention policies. Restoring to different clusters requires understanding namespace conflicts and storage class mapping. AI helps you anticipate the configuration complexity before you hit it in production.

**Prompt 3: Compliance-Driven Backup Requirements**

```
My company needs to comply with SOC 2 Type II. The auditor asks:
1. How do you ensure backups are encrypted at rest?
2. How do you verify backup integrity?
3. Can you prove restore procedures work?

Show me how to configure Velero to answer these questions with evidence.
```

**What you're learning:** Compliance isn't just about having backups - it's about proving they work. AI helps you translate audit requirements into specific Velero configuration: encryption via S3 server-side encryption, integrity via checksum verification, and restore verification via scheduled test restores to non-production namespaces.

**Safety note:** Restore operations can overwrite existing resources. Always use `--include-namespaces` to target specific namespaces. Test restores in non-production environments first. The `--dry-run` flag shows what would be restored without actually modifying the cluster. Production restores should be planned and documented, not improvised during an outage.
