# Capstone: Resilient, Cost-Aware Task API

Your CFO asks why Kubernetes costs doubled last quarter. You open OpenCost and show exactly which team and application drove the increase. Finance schedules a meeting to discuss optimization.

A junior developer accidentally deletes the production namespace. Instead of panic, you restore from yesterday's Velero backup. The database comes back with consistent state because your pre-backup hooks ran pg_dump before the snapshot. Production is back in 25 minutes.

During a Game Day, you kill one Task API pod while monitoring latency. Kubernetes spawns a replacement in 4 seconds. No requests return 5xx errors. You document the RTO: 4 seconds. That's 26 seconds better than your 30-second target.

This is operational excellence. Not a checklist of installed tools, but a system that answers real questions, recovers from real disasters, and proves itself under controlled failure.

This capstone integrates everything from Chapter 59: VPA for right-sizing, cost allocation labels for visibility, Velero for backup, and Chaos Mesh for resilience validation. By the end, your Task API deployment demonstrates production-ready operational excellence.

## Phase 1: Write the Specification

Every production system needs explicit requirements. Before deploying anything, write a specification that defines success.

### Operational Excellence Spec Template

Create a file called `task-api-opex-spec.md`:

```markdown
# Task API Operational Excellence Specification

## 1. Cost Visibility Requirements

**Goal**: Answer "What does Task API cost, and who pays for it?"

**Success Criteria**:
- SC-001: All Task API pods carry four cost allocation labels
  - team: product-team
  - app: task-api
  - environment: production
  - cost-center: engineering
- SC-002: OpenCost returns cost data when queried by team label
- SC-003: VPA generates right-sizing recommendations within 24 hours

## 2. Disaster Recovery Requirements

**Goal**: Recover from namespace deletion within 30 minutes

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 30 minutes
**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 24 hours (daily backups acceptable)

**Success Criteria**:
- SC-004: Velero Schedule runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- SC-005: Backups retain for 30 days (720 hours)
- SC-006: Pre-backup hook runs pg_dump for database consistency
- SC-007: Restore completes within RTO (test in staging)

## 3. Resilience Requirements

**Goal**: Prove Task API survives pod failures

**Success Criteria**:
- SC-008: Pod kill recovery under 30 seconds
- SC-009: No 5xx errors during single pod failure
- SC-010: P95 latency stays under 500ms during recovery

## 4. Constraints

- VPA in Off mode only (recommendations, no automatic restarts)
- Chaos experiments in staging only (not production)
- Cost labels must not conflict with existing selectors
```

### Why Spec First?

Without a specification, you deploy components and hope they work. With a specification:

- You know what "done" looks like (10 success criteria)
- You can verify each requirement independently
- AI can implement components that meet specific criteria
- Post-implementation validation has clear targets

## Phase 2: Component Composition

Now implement each component from previous lessons, composed into a unified deployment.

### Complete Deployment with Cost Labels (from L04)

```yaml
# task-api-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: production
  labels:
    team: product-team
    app: task-api
    environment: production
    cost-center: engineering
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        team: product-team
        app: task-api
        environment: production
        cost-center: engineering
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: task-api
        image: ghcr.io/panaversity/task-api:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
          name: http
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 512Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 1Gi
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: production
  labels:
    team: product-team
    app: task-api
    environment: production
    cost-center: engineering
spec:
  selector:
    app: task-api
  ports:
  - port: 8000
    targetPort: 8000
    name: http
```

**Labels placement is critical**: Labels appear in both `metadata.labels` (for Deployment) and `spec.template.metadata.labels` (for pods). OpenCost reads pod labels, not Deployment labels.

### VPA Configuration (from L02)

```yaml
# task-api-vpa.yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: task-api-vpa
  namespace: production
  labels:
    team: product-team
    app: task-api
    environment: production
    cost-center: engineering
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: task-api
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Off"  # SC-003: Recommendations only
  resourcePolicy:
    containerPolicies:
    - containerName: task-api
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 2000m
        memory: 2Gi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
```

**Why Off mode**: Per the specification, we want recommendations without automatic restarts. After validating recommendations for 1-2 weeks, you can change to Initial or Recreate mode.

### Velero Backup Schedule (from L06)

```yaml
# task-api-velero-schedule.yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: task-api-production-daily
  namespace: velero
  labels:
    team: product-team
    app: task-api
    environment: production
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # SC-004: 2 AM UTC daily
  useOwnerReferencesInBackup: false
  template:
    includedNamespaces:
      - production
    includedResources:
      - "*"
    excludedResources:
      - events
      - pods
      - replicasets
    snapshotVolumes: true
    storageLocation: default
    ttl: 720h  # SC-005: 30-day retention
    metadata:
      labels:
        team: product-team
        app: task-api
        backup-type: daily
    hooks:
      resources:
        - name: postgres-consistency
          includedNamespaces:
            - production
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: postgres
          pre:
            - exec:
                container: postgres
                command:
                  - /bin/bash
                  - -c
                  - |
                    echo "Pre-backup hook started at $(date)"
                    psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "CHECKPOINT;"
                    pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" > /var/lib/postgresql/data/backup.sql
                    echo "Pre-backup hook completed at $(date)"
                onError: Fail  # SC-006: Fail backup if hook fails
                timeout: 120s
          post:
            - exec:
                container: postgres
                command:
                  - /bin/bash
                  - -c
                  - |
                    rm -f /var/lib/postgresql/data/backup.sql
                    echo "Post-backup cleanup completed at $(date)"
                onError: Continue
                timeout: 30s
```

**Hook purpose**: The pre-backup hook runs `CHECKPOINT` to flush PostgreSQL buffers and `pg_dump` for application-level recovery. This ensures SC-006: database consistency during backup.

### PodChaos Experiment (from L07)

```yaml
# task-api-podchaos.yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: task-api-pod-kill
  namespace: chaos-mesh
  labels:
    team: product-team
    app: task-api
    experiment-type: resilience
spec:
  action: pod-kill
  mode: one  # Kill exactly one pod
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - staging  # Per spec: staging only
    labelSelectors:
      app: task-api
  duration: "60s"
```

**Why staging only**: The specification requires chaos experiments in staging, not production. After validating behavior in staging, you can create a production experiment for scheduled Game Days.

## Phase 3: AI Orchestration

You've written a specification and prepared individual components. Now use your operational-excellence skill to verify everything integrates correctly.

### Prompt for AI Implementation Verification

```
I have an Operational Excellence Specification for Task API with these
success criteria:

- SC-001 to SC-003: Cost visibility (labels, OpenCost query, VPA recommendations)
- SC-004 to SC-007: Disaster recovery (Velero schedule, hooks, 30-min RTO)
- SC-008 to SC-010: Resilience (pod kill recovery under 30s, no 5xx, latency)

Using my operational-excellence skill, review these manifests and tell me:
1. Do the cost labels appear in the correct places for OpenCost to read them?
2. Is the VPA configuration safe for production (Off mode only)?
3. Will the Velero hooks provide database consistency?
4. Is the PodChaos experiment scoped correctly for safety?

[Paste the manifests from Phase 2]
```

### What AI Verifies

AI reviews your manifests against the operational-excellence skill patterns:

**Cost Labels Check**:
- Labels in `spec.template.metadata.labels` (where pods get them)
- All four required labels present: team, app, environment, cost-center
- Labels consistent between Deployment metadata and pod template

**VPA Safety Check**:
- `updateMode: "Off"` confirms recommendations-only
- `minAllowed` and `maxAllowed` set reasonable bounds
- No conflict with HPA (none defined)

**Velero Completeness Check**:
- Schedule cron matches requirement (2 AM daily)
- TTL matches requirement (720h = 30 days)
- Hooks include `onError: Fail` for data consistency
- Timeout appropriate for pg_dump (120s)

**Chaos Safety Check**:
- Namespace targeting staging, not production
- Mode is `one` (not `all`)
- Duration limited (60s)

### Iterating with AI

If AI identifies issues, it suggests corrections:

```
Your VPA is correctly in Off mode. However, I notice your Velero Schedule
uses labelSelector on app: postgres, but your Deployment labels show app: task-api.

If your PostgreSQL database has different labels than task-api, the hook is
correct. But if your PostgreSQL is part of the task-api deployment with the
same labels, the hook won't match any pods.

Please verify: What labels does your PostgreSQL pod have?
```

You provide context:

```
PostgreSQL is a separate StatefulSet with labels:
  app: postgres
  team: product-team

It's not part of the task-api Deployment.
```

AI confirms:

```
Good. Your Velero hook selector is correct then. The labelSelector:
matchLabels: app: postgres will match the PostgreSQL StatefulSet pods.

Your manifests look complete. Apply them in this order:
1. Deployment and Service (task-api-deployment.yaml)
2. VPA (task-api-vpa.yaml)
3. Velero Schedule (task-api-velero-schedule.yaml)
4. PodChaos experiment (task-api-podchaos.yaml) - in staging only
```

## Phase 4: Convergence and Validation

Deploy all components and verify each success criterion.

### Apply the Manifests

```bash
# Create production namespace if needed
kubectl create namespace production --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Deploy Task API with cost labels
kubectl apply -f task-api-deployment.yaml

# Apply VPA
kubectl apply -f task-api-vpa.yaml

# Apply Velero Schedule
kubectl apply -f task-api-velero-schedule.yaml

# Apply PodChaos (only in staging)
kubectl annotate namespace staging chaos-mesh.org/inject=enabled --overwrite
kubectl apply -f task-api-podchaos.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
namespace/production configured
deployment.apps/task-api created
service/task-api created
verticalpodautoscaler.autoscaling.k8s.io/task-api-vpa created
schedule.velero.io/task-api-production-daily created
podchaos.chaos-mesh.org/task-api-pod-kill created
```

### Verification Checklist

Work through each success criterion systematically.

#### SC-001: Cost Allocation Labels Present

```bash
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=task-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.labels}' | jq
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "app": "task-api",
  "cost-center": "engineering",
  "environment": "production",
  "team": "product-team",
  "pod-template-hash": "7d8f9c4b5f"
}
```

All four labels present on pods.

#### SC-002: OpenCost Returns Cost Data by Team

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/opencost 9003:9003 &
curl -s "localhost:9003/allocation/compute?window=1d&aggregate=label:team" | jq '.data[0]'
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "product-team": {
    "name": "product-team",
    "cpuCost": 0.0432,
    "memoryCost": 0.0216,
    "totalCost": 0.0648
  }
}
```

OpenCost aggregates costs by team label.

#### SC-003: VPA Generates Recommendations

```bash
kubectl describe vpa task-api-vpa -n production | grep -A 20 "Recommendation:"
```

**Output:**
```yaml
Recommendation:
  Container Recommendations:
    Container Name:  task-api
    Lower Bound:
      Cpu:     100m
      Memory:  200Mi
    Target:
      Cpu:     180m
      Memory:  450Mi
    Upper Bound:
      Cpu:     500m
      Memory:  900Mi
```

VPA recommends 180m CPU and 450Mi memory (lower than your 250m/512Mi requests).

#### SC-004 & SC-005: Velero Schedule Active with 30-Day Retention

```bash
velero schedule describe task-api-production-daily
```

**Output:**
```
Name:         task-api-production-daily
Namespace:    velero
Phase:        Enabled
Schedule:     0 2 * * *
TTL:          720h0m0s
Last Backup:  2025-12-30 02:00:00 +0000 UTC
```

Schedule is enabled with correct timing and retention.

#### SC-006: Backup Hook Runs Successfully

Check the most recent backup for hook execution:

```bash
velero backup describe $(velero backup get | grep task-api | head -1 | awk '{print $1}') --details | grep -A 10 "Hooks:"
```

**Output:**
```
Hooks:
  Resources:
    Name:              postgres-consistency
    Pre Exec Hook:
      Container:       postgres
      Command:         /bin/bash -c echo "Pre-backup hook started..."
      On Error:        Fail
      Timeout:         2m0s
      Execution:       Succeeded
```

Hooks executed successfully.

#### SC-007: Restore Completes Within RTO (Staging Test)

Test restore in staging (never test restores against production):

```bash
# Create a test restore to staging namespace
velero restore create test-restore-$(date +%s) \
  --from-backup task-api-production-daily-$(date +%Y%m%d)020000 \
  --namespace-mappings production:staging-restore-test \
  --include-namespaces production

# Time the restore
time velero restore wait test-restore-*
```

**Output:**
```
Restore completed with status: Completed. Duration: 2m15s.

real    2m15.234s
```

Restore completed in 2 minutes 15 seconds. Well under the 30-minute RTO.

#### SC-008: Pod Kill Recovery Under 30 Seconds

Run the PodChaos experiment and measure recovery:

```bash
# Watch pods in staging
kubectl get pods -n staging -l app=task-api -w &

# Apply chaos experiment
kubectl apply -f task-api-podchaos.yaml

# Record timestamps
echo "Experiment started at: $(date)"
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
task-api-7d8f9c4b5f-abc12   1/1     Running   0          2h
task-api-7d8f9c4b5f-def34   1/1     Running   0          2h

task-api-7d8f9c4b5f-jkl78   0/1     ContainerCreating   0  1s
task-api-7d8f9c4b5f-jkl78   1/1     Running       0       4s

Experiment started at: Mon Dec 30 10:45:00 UTC 2025
```

Recovery time: 4 seconds. Well under the 30-second target.

#### SC-009 & SC-010: No 5xx Errors, Latency Within Target

During the chaos experiment, check for errors:

```bash
# Query Prometheus for error rate during experiment window
curl -s "localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=sum(rate(task_api_requests_total{status=~\"5..\"}[5m]))" | jq '.data.result[0].value[1]'
```

**Output:**
```
"0"
```

Zero 5xx errors during pod kill.

```bash
# Query P95 latency during experiment
curl -s "localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=histogram_quantile(0.95,sum(rate(task_api_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))by(le))*1000" | jq '.data.result[0].value[1]'
```

**Output:**
```
"245.3"
```

P95 latency: 245ms. Under the 500ms target.

## Reflect on Your Skill (Final)

You built an `operational-excellence` skill in Lesson 0. Throughout this chapter, you've tested and improved it. Now finalize it for production use.

### Final Skill Test

```
Using my operational-excellence skill, generate a complete operational
excellence implementation for a new service called "order-service" with:

Requirements:
- 99.9% availability SLO
- RTO: 15 minutes, RPO: 4 hours
- Cost allocation: team=commerce, cost-center=revenue
- Must survive single pod failure without errors

Generate all manifests and a verification checklist.
```

### Verify Complete Coverage

Your skill should produce:

- [ ] Deployment with all four cost allocation labels
- [ ] VPA in Off mode with appropriate bounds
- [ ] Velero Schedule with 6-hour backup frequency (RPO: 4 hours)
- [ ] Pre-backup hooks for database consistency
- [ ] PodChaos experiment for staging
- [ ] Verification commands for each requirement

### Identify and Fill Gaps

If your skill missed any component:

```
My operational-excellence skill generated the Deployment and VPA but forgot
the Velero hooks for database consistency. Update it to always include:

1. Pre-backup hook with pg_dump (or equivalent for the database type)
2. onError: Fail to ensure consistency
3. Appropriate timeout based on database size

Also add a decision tree: "Is this a stateful service with a database?"
If yes, include hooks. If no, skip hooks.
```

### Skill Finalization Checklist

Before adding your skill to your portfolio:

- [ ] Covers all four areas: cost (VPA + labels), backup (Velero), resilience (Chaos Mesh), and visibility (OpenCost)
- [ ] Includes safety guardrails (Off mode for VPA, staging for chaos, onError: Fail for hooks)
- [ ] Generates correct YAML syntax for all CRDs
- [ ] Includes verification commands for each component
- [ ] Decision tree helps select appropriate components based on requirements

### Add to Your Portfolio

Your `operational-excellence` skill is now a Digital FTE component. When you build AI agents or cloud-native applications:

1. Invoke the skill with your service name and requirements
2. Get production-ready manifests
3. Apply and verify with the generated checklist
4. Iterate if requirements change

This is the Agent Factory model: build once, deploy everywhere. Your operational excellence patterns are encoded, tested, and ready to manufacture into any production deployment.

### Prompt 1: Extend to Multi-Service Architecture

```
I've completed the Task API capstone with full operational excellence.
Now I need to extend this to a microservices architecture with:
- task-api (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- notification-service (stateless, sends emails)
- inference-service (GPU workloads, high cost)

How should I structure cost allocation labels, backup schedules, and
chaos experiments differently for each service type?
```

**What you're learning**: Adapting operational excellence patterns to different service characteristics. Stateless services need different backup strategies than databases. GPU workloads need different cost monitoring than CPU-bound services.

### Prompt 2: Automate Verification

```
The verification checklist from the capstone is manual. I want to automate it.
Help me create a script that:
1. Checks all pods have the four cost allocation labels
2. Verifies VPA is in Off mode
3. Confirms Velero Schedule is enabled
4. Runs a chaos experiment and measures recovery time

Output should be a pass/fail report suitable for CI/CD.
```

**What you're learning**: Turning manual verification into automated compliance checks. Production systems need continuous validation, not just initial deployment testing.

### Prompt 3: Handle Failure Scenarios

```
During a Game Day, my Task API took 45 seconds to recover instead of the
target 30 seconds. The pod was killed, but the new pod spent 40 seconds
in ContainerCreating state.

Help me diagnose:
1. What could cause slow container creation?
2. How do I identify the bottleneck (image pull, resource scheduling, init containers)?
3. What changes would reduce recovery time to under 30 seconds?
```

**What you're learning**: Debugging operational performance when targets are missed. Chaos engineering often reveals issues that weren't visible during normal operation. Your skill should help diagnose and fix these issues.

**Safety note**: This capstone deploys real infrastructure that interacts with production systems. Always verify namespace targeting before applying Velero restores or Chaos Mesh experiments. The manifests in this lesson target specific namespaces, but a single typo in `includedNamespaces` can affect unintended resources. Review manifests carefully, and always test in staging before production.
