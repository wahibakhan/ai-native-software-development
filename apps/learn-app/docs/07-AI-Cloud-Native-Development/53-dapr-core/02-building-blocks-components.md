# Building Blocks and Components

You learned Kafka directly in Chapter 52. You wrote code that knew about brokers, topics, and consumer groups. If you wanted to switch from Kafka to RabbitMQ, you'd rewrite your messaging code. Different SDK, different connection logic, different error handling.

Now imagine a different world. You write code that says "publish this message" or "save this state." You don't specify *where* or *how*. That decision lives in a configuration file. To switch from Kafka to RabbitMQ, you change one YAML file. Your application code doesn't change at all.

This is Dapr's abstraction model: **building blocks** provide the API (what you can do), and **components** provide the implementation (how it actually happens). This lesson explores how this separation works and why it matters for portable, maintainable distributed systems.

---

## Building Blocks: The Portable APIs

A **building block** is a Dapr capability exposed through an HTTP or gRPC API. It defines *what* you can do, not *how* it's done underneath.

Think of building blocks like a universal remote control. The remote has buttons for "power," "volume," and "channel." It doesn't care if you're controlling a Samsung TV, a Sony TV, or a projector. Same interface, different devices.

### The Seven Building Blocks (This Chapter)

| Building Block | API Endpoint | What It Does |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Service Invocation** | `/v1.0/invoke/{app-id}/method/{method}` | Call other services with automatic discovery and mTLS |
| **State Management** | `/v1.0/state/{store}` | Key-value storage with consistency options |
| **Pub/Sub** | `/v1.0/publish/{pubsub}/{topic}` | Event messaging with CloudEvents format |
| **Bindings** | `/v1.0/bindings/{binding}` | Input/output triggers for external systems |
| **Jobs** | `/v1.0/jobs/{name}` | Schedule and manage recurring tasks |
| **Secrets** | `/v1.0/secrets/{store}/{key}` | Retrieve secrets from configured stores |
| **Configuration** | `/v1.0/configuration/{store}` | Dynamic configuration with change subscriptions |

### Building Blocks NOT in This Chapter

| Building Block | Why Deferred |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Actors** | Stateful virtual actors require a separate mental model (Chapter 59) |
| **Workflows** | Long-running orchestration builds on actors (Chapter 59) |

### What the API Looks Like

When you use the state management building block, your code makes HTTP calls like:

```http
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "key": "task-123",
    "value": {"title": "Buy groceries", "status": "pending"}
  }
]
```

Notice what's missing from this request:

- No Redis host or port
- No authentication credentials
- No connection pooling configuration
- No retry logic

Your code says "save this state." Dapr handles everything else.

---

## Components: The Pluggable Implementations

A **component** is a Dapr configuration that binds a building block to a specific backend technology.

Continuing the remote control analogy: the component is the IR (infrared) blaster pointed at your specific TV. The remote (building block) doesn't change. The blaster (component) tells Dapr "when someone uses state management, talk to this Redis server."

### Same Building Block, Different Components

The state management building block can use any of these components:

| Component Type | Backend | Use Case |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| `state.redis` | Redis | Development, caching, simple state |
| `state.postgresql` | PostgreSQL | Production, relational queries needed |
| `state.mongodb` | MongoDB | Document-oriented state |
| `state.azure.cosmosdb` | Azure Cosmos DB | Global distribution, multi-region |
| `state.aws.dynamodb` | AWS DynamoDB | AWS-native, serverless scaling |

The pub/sub building block has similar flexibility:

| Component Type | Backend | Use Case |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| `pubsub.redis` | Redis Streams | Development, simple messaging |
| `pubsub.kafka` | Apache Kafka | Production event streaming (Ch52) |
| `pubsub.rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ | Traditional message queuing |
| `pubsub.azure.servicebus` | Azure Service Bus | Azure-native messaging |
| `pubsub.gcp.pubsub` | Google Cloud Pub/Sub | GCP-native messaging |

---

## The Key Insight: Same API, Different Backend

**This is the single most important concept in Dapr.**

Your application code calls the building block API:

```python
from dapr.clients import DaprClient

with DaprClient() as client:
    client.publish_event(
        pubsub_name='pubsub',  # References the component name
        topic_name='task-events',
        data='{"task_id": "123"}'
    )
```

What happens next depends entirely on which component is configured with the name `pubsub`:

- If `pubsub` is configured as `pubsub.redis` → Message goes to Redis Streams
- If `pubsub` is configured as `pubsub.kafka` → Message goes to Kafka
- If `pubsub` is configured as `pubsub.rabbitmq` → Message goes to RabbitMQ

**Your code doesn't know or care.** The component YAML makes that decision.

### The Connection to Chapter 52

In Chapter 52, you wrote Kafka-specific code:

```python
from aiokafka import AIOKafkaProducer

producer = AIOKafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='kafka-bootstrap:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode()
)
await producer.start()
await producer.send_and_wait('task-events', value={'task_id': '123'})
```

With Dapr, that same functionality becomes:

```python
from dapr.clients import DaprClient

with DaprClient() as client:
    client.publish_event(
        pubsub_name='kafka-pubsub',
        topic_name='task-events',
        data='{"task_id": "123"}'
    )
```

The Dapr version is simpler *and* portable. Change the component configuration, and you've switched message brokers without touching code.

---

## Component YAML Structure

Every Dapr component is defined in a YAML file with a consistent structure. Understanding this structure helps you read, write, and debug component configurations.

### Anatomy of a Component

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: redis:6379
    - name: redisPassword
      value: ""
```

Let's examine each part:

| Field | Purpose | Example Values |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `apiVersion` | Dapr component API version | Always `dapr.io/v1alpha1` |
| `kind` | Resource type | Always `Component` |
| `metadata.name` | Name your code references | `statestore`, `pubsub`, `kafka-events` |
| `metadata.namespace` | Kubernetes namespace | `default`, `production` |
| `spec.type` | Building block + backend | `state.redis`, `pubsub.kafka` |
| `spec.version` | Component version | `v1` (most components) |
| `spec.metadata` | Backend-specific config | Host, credentials, options |

### How Your Code Finds the Component

When your code calls:

```python
client.save_state(store_name='statestore', key='task-123', value='...')
```

Dapr looks for a component where `metadata.name` equals `statestore`. The `spec.type` tells Dapr which building block (state) and which implementation (Redis) to use.

### Component Examples

**Redis State Store:**

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

**Kafka Pub/Sub:**

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: kafka-pubsub
spec:
  type: pubsub.kafka
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: brokers
      value: task-events-kafka-bootstrap.kafka.svc.cluster.local:9092
    - name: consumerGroup
      value: dapr-consumer
    - name: authType
      value: none
```

**Kubernetes Secrets Store:**

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-secrets
spec:
  type: secretstores.kubernetes
  version: v1
  metadata: []
```

Notice that some components need extensive configuration (Kafka needs broker addresses and consumer groups), while others need almost none (Kubernetes secrets store uses the cluster's built-in secrets API).

## Swapping Backends: The Portability Payoff

Here's where Dapr's abstraction model pays dividends.

### Scenario: Development vs Production

**Development** (simple setup):

```yaml
# components/pubsub-dev.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: pubsub
spec:
  type: pubsub.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: redis:6379
```

**Production** (robust messaging):

```yaml
# components/pubsub-prod.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: pubsub
spec:
  type: pubsub.kafka
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: brokers
      value: kafka-cluster.production.svc.cluster.local:9092
    - name: consumerGroup
      value: task-api-consumers
    - name: authRequired
      value: "true"
    - name: saslUsername
      secretKeyRef:
        name: kafka-credentials
        key: username
```

**Your application code is identical in both environments.** It publishes to `pubsub` and subscribes to topics. The infrastructure decision—Redis in dev, Kafka in production—lives entirely in configuration.

### Why This Matters

| Concern | Without Dapr | With Dapr |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Code changes for new backend** | Rewrite with new SDK | Change YAML file |
| **Testing with different infra** | Mock or run full infra | Swap to simpler component |
| **Multi-cloud deployment** | Different code per cloud | Different component YAML |
| **Local development** | Full infra stack | Lightweight components |

---

## Scoping Components to Specific Apps

By default, Dapr components are available to all applications in a namespace. You can restrict which apps can access a component using **scopes**.

### Why Scope Components?

- **Security**: Only the payment service should access payment secrets
- **Isolation**: Dev and staging environments shouldn't share state stores
- **Resource management**: High-volume apps get dedicated components

### How to Scope

Add a `scopes` field to your component:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: payment-secrets
spec:
  type: secretstores.kubernetes
  version: v1
  metadata: []
  scopes:
    - payment-service
    - billing-service
```

Only applications with `dapr.io/app-id: payment-service` or `dapr.io/app-id: billing-service` can access this secrets store.

### No Scopes = Available to All

If you omit the `scopes` field, the component is available to every Dapr-enabled app in the namespace.

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Building Block** | A Dapr capability exposed as an API (state, pub/sub, invoke, etc.) |
| **Component** | A YAML configuration binding a building block to a specific backend |
| **Pluggable** | Can be swapped without code changes |
| **Component Spec** | The `spec` section of component YAML defining type and configuration |
| **Scopes** | Restrict which apps can access a component |

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `dapr-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my dapr-deployment skill, explain the difference between a Dapr building block and a Dapr component. Give me a concrete example with state management.
```

Does your skill clearly distinguish these concepts?

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Does my skill explain that building blocks are APIs and components are implementations?
- Does it include component YAML structure guidance?
- Can it help me swap backends by changing YAML?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My dapr-deployment skill doesn't clearly explain building blocks vs components.
Update it to include:
1. Building blocks = portable APIs (state, pubsub, invoke, etc.)
2. Components = pluggable implementations (state.redis, pubsub.kafka, etc.)
3. Same code works with different backends by changing component YAML
```

## Try With AI

You now understand Dapr's abstraction model. Use AI to explore how this applies to your own systems.

### Setup

Open your AI assistant with context about Dapr. These prompts help you apply concepts to real scenarios.

### Prompt 1: Building Block vs Component

```
What's the difference between a Dapr building block and a Dapr component?
Give me a concrete example using state management with Redis.
Show me how the same application code would work if I switched to PostgreSQL.
```

**What you're learning**: The building block/component separation is Dapr's core innovation. This prompt forces you to articulate the abstraction clearly and see how it enables backend swapping.

### Prompt 2: Component YAML Analysis

```
Here's a Dapr component YAML. Explain what each field does:

apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: redis:6379
    - name: redisPassword
      secretKeyRef:
        name: redis-secret
        key: password
```

**What you're learning**: Reading component YAML fluently is essential for debugging and configuration. Notice the `secretKeyRef` pattern—Dapr can pull sensitive values from secret stores instead of hardcoding them.

### Prompt 3: Backend Swapping Strategy

```
How would I swap from Redis pub/sub to Kafka pub/sub in Dapr without changing my application code?
Show me both component YAML files and explain what stays the same vs what changes.
```

**What you're learning**: This is the portability payoff. You'll see that your code references `pubsub_name='pubsub'` and the component YAML decides whether that means Redis or Kafka. The swap is purely configuration.

### Safety Note

When configuring components with credentials, never hardcode passwords in YAML files. Use `secretKeyRef` to reference Kubernetes secrets, or configure the secrets building block to pull from external vaults. Lesson 8 covers secrets management patterns in detail.
