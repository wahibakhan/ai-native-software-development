# Bindings and Triggers

Your Task API runs inside Kubernetes. But the real world doesn't live in your cluster. Customers send webhook callbacks. Scheduled jobs need to run at midnight. Messages arrive in external queues. Files appear in cloud storage. How does your Dapr application respond to these external events---and how does it send data back out?

This is where **bindings** come in. Unlike pub/sub (which connects your microservices to each other), bindings connect your application to **external systems**. An input binding lets external events *trigger* your code. An output binding lets your code *invoke* external systems.

In Lesson 4, you used pub/sub to connect your Task API to a notification service. Both were Dapr applications. Now you'll connect to the outside world: a cron scheduler that triggers cleanup jobs, an HTTP webhook that notifies external monitoring systems, a queue that receives messages from legacy systems.

---

## Input Bindings: External Events Trigger Your Code

An **input binding** makes Dapr call your application when something happens in an external system.

Think of it like a doorbell. When someone presses the button (external event), a signal rings inside your house (your application). You didn't poll for visitors. You didn't check the door every 5 seconds. The event came to you.

### The Cron Input Binding

The simplest input binding is a cron schedule. Dapr calls your endpoint on a schedule---no external infrastructure required.

**Component YAML:**

```yaml
# components/cron-binding.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: cron-binding
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: bindings.cron
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: schedule
      value: "*/5 * * * *"  # Every 5 minutes
    - name: direction
      value: "input"
```

**FastAPI Endpoint:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/cron-binding")
async def handle_cron_trigger():
    """Called by Dapr every 5 minutes."""
    print("Cron triggered! Cleaning up expired todos...")

    # Your cleanup logic here
    expired_count = await cleanup_expired_tasks()

    return {"status": "OK", "cleaned": expired_count}


async def cleanup_expired_tasks() -> int:
    """Clean up tasks older than 30 days."""
    # In a real app, this would query your database
    print("Removing tasks older than 30 days")
    return 42  # Number of tasks cleaned
```

**Output:**

```
>>> # Every 5 minutes, Dapr calls your endpoint
Cron triggered! Cleaning up expired todos...
Removing tasks older than 30 days
>>> # Your endpoint returns success
{"status": "OK", "cleaned": 42}
```

### How Input Bindings Work

```
External System                    Dapr Sidecar              Your Application
     │                                  │                           │
     │  Event occurs                    │                           │
     │──────────────────────────────────>│                           │
     │                                  │  POST /<binding-name>     │
     │                                  │──────────────────────────>│
     │                                  │                           │
     │                                  │  {"status": "OK"}         │
     │                                  │<──────────────────────────│
```

Key points:

1. The endpoint path **must match** the component's `metadata.name` (e.g., `/cron-binding`)
2. Dapr calls your endpoint with a `POST` request
3. Return `{"status": "OK"}` to acknowledge successful processing
4. If you return an error (or don't respond), Dapr may retry depending on the binding type

### Common Input Binding Types

| Component Type | Trigger Source | Use Case |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| `bindings.cron` | Time schedule | Scheduled cleanup, periodic sync |
| `bindings.kafka` | Kafka topic | Legacy Kafka integration |
| `bindings.azure.storagequeues` | Azure Storage Queue | Message processing |
| `bindings.aws.sqs` | AWS SQS | Message processing |
| `bindings.http` | Incoming HTTP | Webhooks from external services |

---

## Output Bindings: Invoke External Systems

An **output binding** lets your code invoke external systems through Dapr's unified API.

Think of it like a universal translator. You speak one language (Dapr's binding API), and it translates to whatever the external system expects---HTTP, AMQP, S3 API, email SMTP.

### HTTP Output Binding

A common use case: calling an external webhook when something happens in your system.

**Component YAML:**

```yaml
# components/http-binding.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: http-binding
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: bindings.http
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: url
      value: "https://monitoring.example.com/webhooks/dapr"
    - name: direction
      value: "output"
```

**Python Code:**

```python
from dapr.clients import DaprClient
import json

async def notify_external_system(event_type: str, task_id: str):
    """Send webhook notification to external monitoring system."""

    payload = json.dumps({
        "event": event_type,
        "task_id": task_id,
        "timestamp": "2025-12-29T10:30:00Z"
    })

    async with DaprClient() as client:
        await client.invoke_binding(
            binding_name='http-binding',
            operation='post',
            data=payload
        )

    print(f"Notified external system: {event_type} for {task_id}")
```

**Output:**

```
>>> # Your code invokes the output binding
await notify_external_system("task.completed", "task-123")
Notified external system: task.completed for task-123
>>> # Dapr sends POST to https://monitoring.example.com/webhooks/dapr
>>> # with your payload
```

### The invoke_binding Method

```python
await client.invoke_binding(
    binding_name='http-binding',    # Must match component metadata.name
    operation='post',               # HTTP method (get, post, put, delete)
    data='{"key": "value"}'         # Payload as string
)
```

Different binding types support different operations:

| Binding Type | Operations |
|--------------|------------|
| `bindings.http` | `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete` |
| `bindings.aws.s3` | `create`, `get`, `delete`, `list` |
| `bindings.smtp` | `create` (sends email) |
| `bindings.azure.blobstorage` | `create`, `get`, `delete`, `list` |

### Output Binding Example: Task Completion Flow

Here's how output bindings fit into a real workflow:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from dapr.clients import DaprClient
import json

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/tasks/{task_id}/complete")
async def complete_task(task_id: str):
    """Mark task complete and notify external system."""

    # 1. Update task status (using state management from Lesson 3)
    async with DaprClient() as client:
        client.save_state(
            store_name='statestore',
            key=f'task-{task_id}',
            value=json.dumps({"status": "completed"})
        )

        # 2. Notify external monitoring via output binding
        await client.invoke_binding(
            binding_name='http-binding',
            operation='post',
            data=json.dumps({
                "event": "task.completed",
                "task_id": task_id
            })
        )

    return {"task_id": task_id, "status": "completed"}
```

**Output:**

```
>>> # Client calls your API
POST /tasks/task-456/complete

>>> # Task status saved to state store
State saved: task-456 -> {"status": "completed"}

>>> # External system notified via binding
Webhook sent to https://monitoring.example.com/webhooks/dapr
```

## Bindings vs Pub/Sub: When to Use Each

This is the question that trips up newcomers: "I can send messages with pub/sub AND with bindings. What's the difference?"

### The Key Distinction

| Aspect | Bindings | Pub/Sub |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Primary purpose** | Connect to external systems | Connect internal microservices |
| **Direction** | Input OR output (one-way) | Publish AND subscribe (bidirectional) |
| **Typical targets** | Cron, webhooks, S3, SQS, email | Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ (for internal messaging) |
| **Dapr involvement** | Source or destination is outside Dapr | Both ends are Dapr applications |

### Decision Framework

**Ask yourself: "Is the other end a Dapr application?"**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    DECISION TREE                        │

│  Is the other system a Dapr-enabled microservice?       │
│                                                         │
│     YES ──────────────> Use Pub/Sub (Lesson 4-5)        │

│     NO ───────────────> Use Bindings                    │
│                         - External webhooks             │
│                         - Cron schedules                │
│                         - Cloud storage triggers        │
│                         - Legacy queue systems          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Examples

| Scenario | Pattern | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Task API notifies Notification Service | **Pub/Sub** | Both are Dapr apps in your cluster |
| Cleanup job runs every night at midnight | **Input Binding** | Cron is external to your app |
| Send alert to PagerDuty when task fails | **Output Binding** | PagerDuty is external system |
| Process messages from legacy IBM MQ | **Input Binding** | Legacy queue isn't Dapr-enabled |
| Task API talks to Order Service | **Pub/Sub** | Both are your microservices |

### Combining Both Patterns

Real systems often use both. Here's a Task API that:

1. Receives cron triggers (input binding)
2. Publishes events to other services (pub/sub)
3. Notifies external monitoring (output binding)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from dapr.clients import DaprClient
from dapr.ext.fastapi import DaprApp
import json

app = FastAPI()
dapr_app = DaprApp(app)

# INPUT BINDING: Cron triggers cleanup
@app.post("/cleanup-cron")
async def handle_cleanup():
    """Triggered by cron every hour."""
    expired_tasks = await find_expired_tasks()

    async with DaprClient() as client:
        for task_id in expired_tasks:
            # PUB/SUB: Notify internal services
            client.publish_event(
                pubsub_name='pubsub',
                topic_name='task-events',
                data=json.dumps({"event": "task.expired", "task_id": task_id})
            )

            # OUTPUT BINDING: Notify external monitoring
            await client.invoke_binding(
                binding_name='monitoring-webhook',
                operation='post',
                data=json.dumps({"alert": "task_expired", "task_id": task_id})
            )

    return {"status": "OK", "expired_count": len(expired_tasks)}


# PUB/SUB: Subscribe to internal events
@dapr_app.subscribe(pubsub='pubsub', topic='order-events')
async def handle_order_event(event_data: dict):
    """React to events from other Dapr services."""
    print(f"Received order event: {event_data}")
    return {"status": "SUCCESS"}
```

---

## The direction Metadata Field

You may have noticed `direction` in the component YAML. This field specifies whether a binding is input, output, or both.

```yaml
metadata:
  - name: direction
    value: "input"   # Triggers your app
    # OR
    value: "output"  # Your app invokes external system
    # OR
    value: "input, output"  # Bidirectional
```

Most bindings default to one direction. The HTTP binding, for example, defaults to output. The cron binding is always input (you can't "invoke" a cron schedule).

---

## Common Binding Patterns

### Pattern 1: Scheduled Tasks with Cron

```yaml
# Run database maintenance every night at 2 AM
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: nightly-maintenance
spec:
  type: bindings.cron
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: schedule
      value: "0 2 * * *"
```

### Pattern 2: Webhook Receiver

```yaml
# Receive webhooks from payment provider
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: payment-webhook
spec:
  type: bindings.http
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: direction
      value: "input"
```

```python
@app.post("/payment-webhook")
async def handle_payment_webhook(request: Request):
    """Stripe/PayPal/etc. calls this endpoint."""
    body = await request.json()
    print(f"Payment event received: {body}")
    return {"status": "OK"}
```

### Pattern 3: Cloud Storage Triggers

```yaml
# React to files uploaded to S3
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: s3-trigger
spec:
  type: bindings.aws.s3
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: bucket
      value: "task-attachments"
    - name: region
      value: "us-east-1"
    - name: accessKey
      secretKeyRef:
        name: aws-credentials
        key: access-key
    - name: secretKey
      secretKeyRef:
        name: aws-credentials
        key: secret-key
```

---

## Debugging Bindings

When bindings don't work, check these common issues:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Endpoint never called | Path doesn't match component name | Ensure `/binding-name` matches `metadata.name` |
| 404 errors in logs | Wrong HTTP method | Input bindings use POST, not GET |
| Cron never triggers | Invalid schedule syntax | Verify cron expression at crontab.guru |
| Output binding fails | Wrong operation | Check supported operations for binding type |

Check Dapr sidecar logs:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/task-api -c daprd | grep -i binding
```

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `dapr-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my dapr-deployment skill, create a cron binding that triggers every 5 minutes. Show me the component YAML and the FastAPI handler.
```

Does your skill generate correct component YAML with the `direction` metadata?

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:

- Does my skill explain input vs output bindings?
- Can it show when to use bindings vs pub/sub?
- Does it include the endpoint naming convention (path must match component name)?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My dapr-deployment skill needs binding patterns.
Add these concepts:
1. Input bindings trigger your app from external events (cron, webhooks)
2. Output bindings invoke external systems (HTTP, S3, email)
3. Endpoint path must match component metadata.name
4. Use bindings for external systems, pub/sub for internal services
```

---

## Try With AI

Apply binding patterns to your own integration scenarios.

**Setup:** Open Claude Code or your preferred AI assistant in your Dapr project directory.

---

**Prompt 1: Create a Cron Binding**

```
Create a Dapr cron binding that triggers a cleanup endpoint every 5 minutes.
Show me:
1. The component YAML with correct schedule syntax
2. The FastAPI handler that receives the trigger
3. How to verify the binding is working

I'm using Dapr 1.14 on Kubernetes.
```

**What you're learning:** Input bindings connect external triggers to your code. The cron binding is the simplest example---no external infrastructure, just time-based triggers. Pay attention to the naming convention: endpoint path must match component name.

---

**Prompt 2: HTTP Output Binding**

```
Create an HTTP output binding to call an external webhook when tasks are completed.
Show me:
1. The component YAML for the output binding
2. Async DaprClient usage to invoke the binding
3. How to pass JSON payload to the external endpoint

The webhook URL is https://monitoring.internal/webhooks/tasks
```

**What you're learning:** Output bindings abstract away external HTTP calls. Instead of managing HTTP clients, retries, and error handling, you configure once and invoke through Dapr's unified API. The `invoke_binding` method is your interface to any external system.

---

**Prompt 3: Bindings vs Pub/Sub Decision**

```
I'm building a task management system with these integration needs:
1. Run cleanup every night at midnight
2. Notify my Notification Service when tasks are created
3. Send alerts to PagerDuty when tasks fail
4. Process incoming webhooks from a third-party calendar service

For each scenario, tell me:
- Should I use bindings or pub/sub?
- Why?
- What component type would I use?

Give me a clear decision framework I can apply to future scenarios.
```

**What you're learning:** The key distinction is internal vs external. Pub/sub connects your Dapr microservices. Bindings connect to the outside world. This prompt helps you internalize the decision framework and apply it consistently.

---

**Safety Note:** When configuring bindings that receive webhooks, validate the source. Add authentication (API keys, signatures) to prevent malicious actors from triggering your endpoints. Check the Dapr documentation for your specific binding type's security options.
