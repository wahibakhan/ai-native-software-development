# Build Your Dapr Skill

Before learning Dapr—building distributed microservices with sidecar architecture—you'll **own** a Dapr skill.

---

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

```bash
cd claude-code-skills-lab
claude
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your Skill

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for Dapr (Distributed Application
Runtime). I will use it to build distributed microservices from hello world to
professional production systems. Use context7 skill to study official documentation
and then build it so no self assumed knowledge.
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch official Dapr documentation via Context7
2. Ask you clarifying questions (building blocks, state stores, pub/sub backends)
3. Create the complete skill with references and templates

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/dapr-deployment/`.

---

## Done

You now own a Dapr skill built from official documentation. The rest of this chapter teaches you what it knows—and how to make it better.
