# Jobs and CronJobs: Batch Workloads for AI Agents

Deployments keep your AI agent running forever. But what about tasks that should run once and stop? Or tasks that run on a schedule?

- **Refresh vector embeddings** every night at 2 AM
- **Clean up old conversation logs** weekly
- **Run a one-time data migration** when you upgrade models
- **Generate daily analytics reports** from agent interactions

These are **batch workloads**—finite tasks that complete and exit. Kubernetes provides two primitives for this: **Jobs** (run once) and **CronJobs** (run on a schedule).

---

## Long-Running vs. Finite Workloads

You've learned that Deployments manage Pods that should run continuously. But not all workloads are long-running:

```
Deployment (Long-Running):
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Pod runs forever → crashes → restarts → runs forever   │
│  Example: FastAPI agent serving requests 24/7           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Job (Finite):
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Pod starts → does work → completes → stops             │
│  Example: Refresh embeddings, exit when done            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

CronJob (Scheduled Finite):
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Every night at 2 AM: create Job → does work → stops    │
│  Example: Nightly log cleanup                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: Deployments use `restartPolicy: Always`—Pods restart on completion. Jobs use `restartPolicy: Never` or `OnFailure`—Pods don't restart after successful completion.

---

## Your First Job: A One-Time Task

Create a Job that simulates an AI agent maintenance task—processing data and exiting:

### Job YAML Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: embedding-refresh
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: refresh
        image: python:3.11-slim
        command: ["python", "-c"]
        args:
          - |
            import time
            print("Starting embedding refresh...")
            for i in range(5):
                print(f"Processing batch {i+1}/5...")
                time.sleep(2)
            print("Embedding refresh complete!")
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

**Output:**
(This is the manifest structure; we'll apply it next)

### Understanding Each Field

**`apiVersion: batch/v1`**
Jobs use the `batch` API group, not `apps` like Deployments.

**`kind: Job`**
Tells Kubernetes this is a finite workload.

**`spec.template`**
The Pod template—identical to what you'd put in a Deployment's template. The Job creates one or more Pods using this template.

**`restartPolicy: Never`**
Critical difference from Deployments. When the container exits with code 0 (success), the Pod stays `Completed` and doesn't restart.

**`backoffLimit: 4`**
If the container fails (non-zero exit code), Kubernetes retries up to 4 times before marking the Job as failed.

---

## Running and Monitoring the Job

Save the manifest as `embedding-refresh-job.yaml` and apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f embedding-refresh-job.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
job.batch/embedding-refresh created
```

Watch the Job progress:

```bash
kubectl get jobs -w
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
embedding-refresh   0/1           3s         3s
embedding-refresh   0/1           12s        12s
embedding-refresh   1/1           12s        12s
```

Check the Pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
embedding-refresh-7x9kq   0/1     Completed   0          45s
```

Notice **STATUS: Completed**—the Pod finished successfully and stopped. Unlike a Deployment Pod (which would show `Running`), this Pod is done.

View the logs to see what happened:

```bash
kubectl logs embedding-refresh-7x9kq
```

**Output:**
```
Starting embedding refresh...
Processing batch 1/5...
Processing batch 2/5...
Processing batch 3/5...
Processing batch 4/5...
Processing batch 5/5...
Embedding refresh complete!
```

The Job ran, completed its task, and stopped. The Pod remains in `Completed` state for inspection (logs, debugging) until you delete it.

---

## The Job → Pod Relationship

```
Job: embedding-refresh
    ↓ creates and manages
Pod: embedding-refresh-7x9kq (status: Completed)
```

Unlike Deployments (which use ReplicaSets as intermediaries), Jobs directly manage their Pods. The naming follows the pattern: `{job-name}-{random-suffix}`.

Delete the Job (this also deletes its Pods):

```bash
kubectl delete job embedding-refresh
```

**Output:**
```
job.batch "embedding-refresh" deleted
```

---

## Parallel Jobs: Processing in Batches

What if you need to process 10,000 documents for embedding refresh? Running sequentially takes too long. Jobs support parallelism:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: batch-processor
spec:
  completions: 5      # Total tasks to complete
  parallelism: 2      # Run 2 Pods at a time
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: processor
        image: busybox:1.36
        command: ["sh", "-c"]
        args:
          - |
            echo "Processing task on $(hostname)..."
            sleep 5
            echo "Task complete!"
      restartPolicy: Never
```

**Key parameters:**

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `completions` | 5 | The Job needs 5 successful Pod completions |
| `parallelism` | 2 | Run up to 2 Pods simultaneously |

Apply and watch:

```bash
kubectl apply -f batch-processor.yaml
kubectl get pods -w
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
batch-processor-abc12   1/1     Running   0          2s
batch-processor-def34   1/1     Running   0          2s
batch-processor-abc12   0/1     Completed 0          7s
batch-processor-ghi56   1/1     Running   0          1s
batch-processor-def34   0/1     Completed 0          8s
batch-processor-jkl78   1/1     Running   0          1s
...
```

Kubernetes maintains 2 Pods running at any time until 5 completions are achieved.

Check Job status:

```bash
kubectl get jobs batch-processor
```

**Output:**
```
NAME              COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
batch-processor   5/5           18s        25s
```

---

## Job Operation Types Summary

| Type | completions | parallelism | Behavior |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Non-parallel** | 1 (default) | 1 (default) | Single Pod, single completion |
| **Parallel with fixed count** | N | M | Run M Pods at a time until N completions |
| **Work queue** | unset | M | Run M Pods, complete when any Pod succeeds and all terminate |

For AI workloads, **parallel with fixed count** is most common—split a large dataset into chunks and process in parallel.

---

## CronJobs: Scheduled Batch Work

CronJobs create Jobs on a schedule. Every execution creates a new Job, which creates new Pod(s).

```
CronJob: nightly-cleanup (schedule: "0 2 * * *")
    ↓ creates at 2:00 AM
Job: nightly-cleanup-28473049
    ↓ creates
Pod: nightly-cleanup-28473049-abc12 (status: Completed)
```

### Cron Expression Syntax

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Common patterns:

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `0 2 * * *` | Every day at 2:00 AM |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Every Sunday at midnight |
| `0 6 1 * *` | First day of each month at 6:00 AM |

### Creating a CronJob

Create a CronJob that cleans up old agent logs every minute (for demonstration—in production, use a longer schedule):

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: log-cleanup
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"    # Every minute (for demo)
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: cleanup
            image: busybox:1.36
            command: ["sh", "-c"]
            args:
              - |
                echo "Running log cleanup at $(date)"
                echo "Removing logs older than 7 days..."
                echo "Cleanup complete!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
```

**New fields:**

**`schedule`**
Cron expression defining when to create Jobs.

**`jobTemplate`**
The Job template—notice it's the same structure as a Job spec, wrapped in `jobTemplate.spec`.

**`successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3`**
Keep the last 3 successful Jobs (and their Pods) for inspection. Older ones are auto-deleted.

**`failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1`**
Keep only the last failed Job for debugging.

Apply and watch:

```bash
kubectl apply -f log-cleanup-cronjob.yaml
kubectl get cronjobs
```

**Output:**
```
NAME          SCHEDULE    SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
log-cleanup   * * * * *   False     0        <none>          10s
```

Wait a minute and check again:

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs
```

**Output:**
```
NAME          SCHEDULE    SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
log-cleanup   * * * * *   False     0        45s             90s
```

List Jobs created by the CronJob:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                     COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
log-cleanup-28504821     1/1           3s         75s
log-cleanup-28504822     1/1           2s         15s
```

Each Job name includes a timestamp-based suffix (28504821, 28504822).

---

## CronJob Concurrency Policies

What if a Job is still running when the next schedule triggers? Configure with `concurrencyPolicy`:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `Allow` (default) | Create new Job even if previous is running |
| `Forbid` | Skip the new Job if previous is still running |
| `Replace` | Cancel the running Job and start a new one |

For AI workloads (like embedding refresh), use `Forbid` to prevent overlapping:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: embedding-refresh-nightly
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid    # Don't overlap runs
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: refresh
            image: your-registry/embedding-refresher:v1
            env:
            - name: VECTOR_DB_URL
              value: "http://qdrant:6333"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

---

## AI Agent Use Cases for Jobs and CronJobs

### Use Case 1: Nightly Embedding Refresh

Your RAG agent needs fresh embeddings from updated knowledge base:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: embedding-sync
spec:
  schedule: "0 3 * * *"    # 3 AM daily
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: sync
            image: your-registry/embedding-sync:v1
            env:
            - name: OPENAI_API_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: openai-credentials
                  key: api-key
            - name: QDRANT_URL
              value: "http://qdrant:6333"
            resources:
              requests:
                memory: "512Mi"
                cpu: "500m"
              limits:
                memory: "1Gi"
                cpu: "1"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

### Use Case 2: One-Time Model Migration

When upgrading your agent's model, run a migration Job:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: model-migration-v2
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: migrate
        image: your-registry/model-migrator:v2
        env:
        - name: SOURCE_MODEL
          value: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
        - name: TARGET_MODEL
          value: "gpt-4o-mini"
        - name: DB_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: connection-string
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 2
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600  # Auto-delete after 1 hour
```

**`ttlSecondsAfterFinished`**: Automatically delete the Job and its Pods after the specified seconds. Useful for one-time migrations you don't need to keep.

### Use Case 3: Parallel Document Processing

Process 1000 documents for a new knowledge base:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: document-ingest
spec:
  completions: 100    # 100 batches (10 docs each)
  parallelism: 10     # Process 10 batches simultaneously
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ingest
        image: your-registry/doc-processor:v1
        env:
        - name: JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations['batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index']
      restartPolicy: Never
```

**`JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX`**: Kubernetes injects a unique index (0-99) into each Pod. Your code uses this to determine which batch of documents to process.

---

## Key Concepts Summary

**Job**: Kubernetes primitive for running a task to completion. Creates Pods that stop after successful execution.

**CronJob**: Creates Jobs on a schedule using cron expressions. Manages Job history automatically.

**completions**: Number of successful Pod completions required for the Job to finish.

**parallelism**: Maximum number of Pods that can run simultaneously.

**restartPolicy**: Must be `Never` or `OnFailure` for Jobs (not `Always`).

**backoffLimit**: Number of retries before marking a Job as failed.

**concurrencyPolicy**: How CronJobs handle overlapping executions (`Allow`, `Forbid`, `Replace`).

**ttlSecondsAfterFinished**: Auto-cleanup of completed Jobs after a time period.

---

## Try With AI

Open a terminal and work through these scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Design a Backup Job

**Your task:**
Create a Job that backs up your agent's conversation history to an S3 bucket.

Ask AI: "Create a Kubernetes Job manifest that runs an S3 backup using the AWS CLI. It should copy files from /data/conversations to s3://my-bucket/backups/."

Review AI's response:
- Is the image appropriate (e.g., `amazon/aws-cli`)?
- Are AWS credentials handled securely (via Secrets, not hardcoded)?
- Is `restartPolicy` set correctly?
- Is there a `backoffLimit` for retries?

Tell AI: "The Job should mount a PersistentVolumeClaim named 'agent-data' to access the conversation files."

**Reflection:**
- How does the Job access the PVC?
- What happens if the S3 upload fails mid-transfer?
- Would you use `restartPolicy: Never` or `OnFailure` here?

### Scenario 2: Debug a Failing CronJob

**Your task:**
Your nightly CronJob hasn't run successfully in 3 days. Diagnose the issue.

Ask AI: "My CronJob named 'nightly-sync' shows LAST SCHEDULE was 3 days ago but ACTIVE is 0. What commands should I run to diagnose this?"

AI should suggest:
- `kubectl describe cronjob nightly-sync`
- `kubectl get jobs` (look for failed Jobs)
- `kubectl describe job <failed-job-name>`
- `kubectl logs <pod-name>`

Ask: "The Job Pod shows ImagePullBackOff. What does this mean and how do I fix it?"

**Reflection:**
- What's the difference between CronJob, Job, and Pod failures?
- Where do you look first when a CronJob stops working?
- How does `failedJobsHistoryLimit` affect debugging?

### Scenario 3: Optimize Parallel Processing

**Your task:**
You have a Job processing 1000 items with `completions: 1000` and `parallelism: 50`. It's consuming too many cluster resources.

Ask AI: "How can I run a Kubernetes Job that processes 1000 items but limits resource consumption? Currently using parallelism: 50 but it's overwhelming the cluster."

AI might suggest:
- Reduce `parallelism` to 10-20
- Add resource requests/limits to each Pod
- Use indexed Jobs with a work queue pattern
- Process multiple items per Pod (reduce total completions)

Ask: "Show me how to use a work queue pattern instead of one Pod per item."

**Reflection:**
- What's the trade-off between parallelism and completion time?
- When is the indexed Job pattern better than a work queue?
- How do resource limits on Job Pods affect scheduling?

---

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `kubernetes-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my kubernetes-deployment skill, create a Job for batch processing and a CronJob for scheduled tasks.
Does my skill generate Job manifests with completions, parallelism, and proper restartPolicy?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include Job vs Deployment distinction (finite vs long-running workloads)?
- Did it explain parallelism and completions for batch processing?
- Did it cover CronJob scheduling with cron expressions and concurrency policies?
- Did it include AI agent use cases (embedding refresh, log cleanup, model migration)?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My kubernetes-deployment skill is missing Job and CronJob patterns for batch workloads.
Update it to include Job parallelism configuration, CronJob scheduling syntax, concurrency policies, and AI-specific batch processing patterns.
```
