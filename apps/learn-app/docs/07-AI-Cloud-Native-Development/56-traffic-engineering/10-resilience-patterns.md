# Resilience Patterns

Your service is healthy. All pods are running, health checks pass, metrics look green. Then a network glitch causes a database connection to drop for 200 milliseconds. Without retry logic, that request fails permanently. A user sees an error. They refresh, it works—but trust erodes. Meanwhile, during a Kubernetes node upgrade, all your pods get evicted simultaneously because you forgot to create a PodDisruptionBudget. Your service goes down for 90 seconds while new pods start. Both failures were preventable.

Resilience patterns prepare your services for the failures that will happen. Networks are unreliable. Pods get evicted. Dependencies slow down. The question is not whether failures occur, but whether your system handles them gracefully. This lesson teaches production-grade patterns: retry policies that recover from transient failures, timeouts that prevent resource exhaustion, PodDisruptionBudgets that protect during maintenance, and graceful shutdown that completes in-flight requests.

By the end, you will configure retry policies with exponential backoff, set request and connection timeouts, create PDBs that guarantee minimum availability, and implement graceful shutdown with preStop hooks.

## The Resilience Stack

Production resilience operates at multiple layers. Each layer handles different failure modes:

| Layer | Pattern | What It Protects Against |
|-------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Request** | Retries | Transient failures (network blips, temporary overload) |
| **Request** | Timeouts | Slow dependencies (prevent thread exhaustion) |
| **Connection** | Outlier detection | Unhealthy backends (exclude failing pods) |
| **Pod** | Liveness/Readiness probes | Application failures (restart unhealthy pods) |
| **Pod** | Graceful shutdown | Termination (complete in-flight work) |
| **Deployment** | PDB | Maintenance disruptions (guarantee availability) |

## Retry Policies

Retries automatically resend failed requests. A 500ms network timeout does not mean the operation failed—the server may have completed successfully. Retry policies distinguish between failures worth retrying (transient) and failures that should not be retried (permanent).

### Understanding Retry Behavior

| Failure Type | Should Retry? | Example |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Network timeout | Yes | TCP connection dropped |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Yes | Upstream temporarily unavailable |
| 503 Service Unavailable | Yes | Server overloaded |
| 504 Gateway Timeout | Yes | Upstream too slow |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Maybe | Depends on idempotency |
| 400 Bad Request | No | Client error, won't fix on retry |
| 401 Unauthorized | No | Auth failure, won't fix on retry |
| 404 Not Found | No | Resource doesn't exist |

### Configuring Retry Policy with BackendTrafficPolicy

Configure retries using Envoy Gateway's BackendTrafficPolicy:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackendTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: task-api-retry
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      name: task-api-route
  retry:
    numRetries: 3
    perRetry:
      backOff:
        baseInterval: 100ms
        maxInterval: 2s
      timeout: 500ms
    retryOn:
      httpStatusCodes:
        - 502
        - 503
        - 504
      triggers:
        - connect-failure
        - retriable-status-codes
        - reset
```

**Apply and verify:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-retry.yaml
kubectl get backendtrafficpolicy -n task-api
```

**Output:**

```
NAME             AGE
task-api-retry   5s
```

### Understanding Retry Fields

| Field | Purpose | Recommended Values |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `numRetries` | Maximum retry attempts | 2-5 (higher = more latency) |
| `perRetry.timeout` | Timeout per individual attempt | 100ms-1s (based on expected latency) |
| `perRetry.backOff.baseInterval` | Initial delay between retries | 25ms-200ms |
| `perRetry.backOff.maxInterval` | Maximum delay (exponential caps here) | 1s-5s |
| `retryOn.httpStatusCodes` | Status codes that trigger retry | 502, 503, 504 (server errors) |
| `retryOn.triggers` | Failure conditions that trigger retry | connect-failure, reset |

### Exponential Backoff

Exponential backoff increases delay between retries to avoid overwhelming a recovering service:

```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait baseInterval (100ms)
Attempt 3: Wait 2 × baseInterval (200ms)
Attempt 4: Wait 4 × baseInterval (400ms), capped at maxInterval
```

**Why exponential?** If the server is overloaded, retrying immediately adds more load. Exponential backoff gives the server time to recover.

### Testing Retry Behavior

Create a service that fails intermittently:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: flaky-app
  namespace: task-api
data:
  main.py: |
    from flask import Flask
    import random
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/api/tasks')
    def tasks():
        if random.random() < 0.5:  # 50% failure rate
            return "Service temporarily unavailable", 503
        return "Success", 200

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

**Test without retries:**

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
done | sort | uniq -c
```

**Output (no retries):**

```
   5 200
   5 503
```

**With retry policy applied, same requests:**

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
done | sort | uniq -c
```

**Output (with retries):**

```
   9 200
   1 503
```

Most failures recovered through automatic retry.

---

## Timeout Configuration

Timeouts prevent slow dependencies from exhausting resources. Without timeouts, a thread waiting for a response that never comes holds resources indefinitely. Multiply by concurrent requests, and your service runs out of threads.

### Types of Timeouts

| Timeout Type | What It Controls | When to Set |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Request timeout** | Total time for complete request | Always |
| **Per-retry timeout** | Time for single retry attempt | With retry policy |
| **Idle timeout** | Time connection can be idle | Long-lived connections |
| **Connection timeout** | Time to establish TCP connection | Always |

### Configuring Timeouts

Configure timeouts in BackendTrafficPolicy:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackendTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: task-api-timeouts
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      name: task-api-route
  timeout:
    http:
      requestTimeout: 30s
      idleTimeout: 5m
      connectionIdleTimeout: 1h
```

**Apply and verify:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-timeouts.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
backendtrafficpolicy.gateway.envoyproxy.io/task-api-timeouts created
```

### Timeout Field Meanings

| Field | Description | Recommended |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `requestTimeout` | Max time from first byte to last byte | 10-60s for APIs |
| `idleTimeout` | Max time with no data on connection | 30s-5m |
| `connectionIdleTimeout` | Max time to keep idle connection in pool | 1h-24h |

### Testing Timeout Behavior

Simulate slow responses:

```bash
# Create slow endpoint (sleeps 45 seconds)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks?delay=45s
```

**Output (with 30s timeout):**

```
upstream request timeout
```

The request times out after 30 seconds instead of waiting 45 seconds.

### Combining Retries and Timeouts

When using retries, set per-retry timeout shorter than request timeout:

```yaml
retry:
  numRetries: 3
  perRetry:
    timeout: 5s    # Each attempt gets 5s
timeout:
  http:
    requestTimeout: 20s   # Total request gets 20s
```

**Why?** If each retry takes the full request timeout, 3 retries × 30s = 90s total wait. With 5s per-retry timeout: 3 retries × 5s + backoff = ~20s maximum.

---

## PodDisruptionBudget

Kubernetes may evict pods for many reasons: node upgrades, scaling down, resource pressure. Without protection, Kubernetes can evict all your pods simultaneously, causing an outage. PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) guarantees minimum availability during voluntary disruptions.

### What PDB Protects

| Disruption Type | PDB Applies? | Examples |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Voluntary** | Yes | Node drain, cluster upgrade, `kubectl delete` |
| **Involuntary** | No | Node crash, OOM kill, hardware failure |

PDB does not protect against node failures—it protects against planned maintenance.

### Creating a PodDisruptionBudget

Guarantee at least 2 pods available during disruptions:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: task-api-pdb
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
```

**Apply and verify:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-pdb.yaml
kubectl get pdb -n task-api
```

**Output:**

```
NAME           MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
task-api-pdb   2               N/A               1                     10s
```

### PDB Field Options

| Field | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `minAvailable` | Minimum pods that must be available | When you know minimum needed for traffic |
| `maxUnavailable` | Maximum pods that can be unavailable | When you know how many can fail |

**Either minAvailable OR maxUnavailable, not both.**

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Option 1: At least 2 pods always available
spec:
  minAvailable: 2

# Option 2: At most 1 pod unavailable at a time
spec:
  maxUnavailable: 1

# Option 3: Percentage (at least 50% available)
spec:
  minAvailable: "50%"
```

### Testing PDB Behavior

Try to drain a node when PDB would be violated:

```bash
# With 3 replicas and minAvailable: 2
kubectl drain node-1 --ignore-daemonsets
```

**Output (if 2 pods on node-1):**

```
error when evicting pod "task-api-xxx": Cannot evict pod as it would violate the
pod's disruption budget.
```

Kubernetes refuses to drain the node because it would leave fewer than 2 pods.

### PDB Best Practices

| Scenario | Recommended PDB |
|----------|----------------|
| 3 replicas | `minAvailable: 2` or `maxUnavailable: 1` |
| 5+ replicas | `minAvailable: "60%"` or `maxUnavailable: "40%"` |
| Single replica | No PDB (or `maxUnavailable: 0` blocks all drains) |
| Stateful workload | `maxUnavailable: 1` (sequential drains) |

---

## Liveness and Readiness Probes

Probes tell Kubernetes whether your pod is healthy. Without probes, Kubernetes cannot detect application failures—a crashed process inside a running container looks healthy from outside.

### Probe Types

| Probe | Purpose | Action on Failure |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Liveness** | Is the container alive? | Restart container |
| **Readiness** | Is the container ready for traffic? | Remove from Service endpoints |
| **Startup** | Is the container starting up? | Delay liveness/readiness checks |

### Configuring Probes

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: task-api
          image: task-api:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 3
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /ready
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
            timeoutSeconds: 3
            failureThreshold: 2
          startupProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 0
            periodSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 30  # 30 × 5s = 150s startup time
```

**Apply and verify:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods -n task-api
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
task-api-7b9c4d6f5-abc12   1/1     Running   0          30s
task-api-7b9c4d6f5-def34   1/1     Running   0          30s
task-api-7b9c4d6f5-ghi56   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### Understanding Probe Fields

| Field | Purpose | Guidance |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `initialDelaySeconds` | Wait before first probe | App startup time |
| `periodSeconds` | Time between probes | 5-10s typical |
| `timeoutSeconds` | Max time for probe response | 1-5s |
| `failureThreshold` | Failures before action | 2-5 (avoid flapping) |
| `successThreshold` | Successes to recover | 1 (for liveness), 1-3 (for readiness) |

### Liveness vs Readiness

**Liveness probe failure** → Container restarts. Use for detecting deadlocks, infinite loops, or crashed applications.

**Readiness probe failure** → Traffic stops. Use for temporary unavailability (database reconnecting, cache warming).

**Common mistake**: Using liveness probe for dependency health. If your database is down, restarting your app won't fix it—and creates restart loops.

---

## Graceful Shutdown

When Kubernetes terminates a pod, it sends SIGTERM. If your application does not handle SIGTERM, in-flight requests fail. Graceful shutdown completes ongoing work before exiting.

### The Termination Sequence

```
1. Pod marked for termination
2. Pod removed from Service endpoints (new traffic stops)
3. preStop hook executes (if configured)
4. SIGTERM sent to container
5. Wait terminationGracePeriodSeconds
6. SIGKILL sent (forced termination)
```

**The race condition**: Steps 2-4 happen nearly simultaneously. Traffic may still arrive while preStop is running.

### Configuring Graceful Shutdown

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
      containers:
        - name: task-api
          image: task-api:v1
          lifecycle:
            preStop:
              exec:
                command:
                  - /bin/sh
                  - -c
                  - "sleep 10"  # Wait for endpoints to propagate
```

**Why `sleep 10`?** Kubernetes endpoints propagation is not instant. The preStop delay ensures traffic stops arriving before your app begins shutdown.

### Application-Level Graceful Shutdown

Your application should handle SIGTERM:

```python
# Python example
import signal
import sys
import time

# Global flag for shutdown
shutting_down = False

def handle_sigterm(signum, frame):
    global shutting_down
    print("Received SIGTERM, starting graceful shutdown")
    shutting_down = True

signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)

# In your request handler
def handle_request(request):
    if shutting_down:
        return Response("Service shutting down", status=503)
    # Process request...

# In your main loop
while not shutting_down:
    # Accept and process requests
    pass

# Wait for in-flight requests to complete
time.sleep(5)
print("Graceful shutdown complete")
sys.exit(0)
```

**Output (during termination):**

```
Received SIGTERM, starting graceful shutdown
Completing 3 in-flight requests...
Graceful shutdown complete
```

### Graceful Shutdown Timing

| Setting | Purpose | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | Total time for graceful shutdown | 30-60s |
| preStop sleep | Wait for endpoints propagation | 5-15s |
| Application drain | Complete in-flight work | Remaining time |

**Formula**: `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` = preStop sleep + max request duration + buffer

---

## Outlier Detection

Outlier detection automatically excludes unhealthy backends from the load balancer. If one pod starts returning errors while others are healthy, outlier detection removes it from rotation without waiting for probes.

### Configuring Outlier Detection

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackendTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: task-api-outlier
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      name: task-api-route
  healthCheck:
    passive:
      consecutiveGatewayErrors: 5
      interval: 10s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
      maxEjectionPercent: 50
```

**Apply and verify:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-outlier.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
backendtrafficpolicy.gateway.envoyproxy.io/task-api-outlier created
```

### Outlier Detection Fields

| Field | Purpose | Recommended |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `consecutiveGatewayErrors` | Errors before ejection | 3-10 |
| `interval` | Time between error checks | 5-30s |
| `baseEjectionTime` | Initial ejection duration | 30s-5m |
| `maxEjectionPercent` | Max backends that can be ejected | 10-50% |

### How Outlier Detection Works

```
Normal State
─────────────
Pod A: Serving traffic ✓
Pod B: Serving traffic ✓
Pod C: Serving traffic ✓

Pod B Returns 5 Consecutive Errors
──────────────────────────────────
Pod A: Serving traffic ✓
Pod B: EJECTED (30s timeout) ✗
Pod C: Serving traffic ✓

After 30s, Pod B Allowed Back
─────────────────────────────
Pod A: Serving traffic ✓
Pod B: Serving traffic (on probation) ✓
Pod C: Serving traffic ✓
```

### Combining Outlier Detection with Retries

Outlier detection works well with retries:

1. Request to Pod B fails (error #1)
2. Retry policy retries to Pod A (success)
3. After 5 errors, Pod B ejected
4. All traffic goes to healthy pods
5. Pod B recovers, rejoins rotation

---

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Configure Retry Policy

Create retry policy with exponential backoff:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackendTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: exercise-retry
  namespace: default
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      name: task-api-route
  retry:
    numRetries: 3
    perRetry:
      backOff:
        baseInterval: 100ms
        maxInterval: 1s
      timeout: 500ms
    retryOn:
      httpStatusCodes:
        - 503
      triggers:
        - connect-failure
EOF
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get backendtrafficpolicy exercise-retry
```

**Expected Output:**

```
NAME             AGE
exercise-retry   5s
```

### Exercise 2: Configure Timeouts

Add timeout configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackendTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: exercise-timeout
  namespace: default
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      name: task-api-route
  timeout:
    http:
      requestTimeout: 15s
      idleTimeout: 60s
EOF
```

**Test with slow request:**

```bash
# This should timeout after 15s
time curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks?delay=20s
```

**Expected Output:**

```
upstream request timeout
real    0m15.xxx
```

### Exercise 3: Create PodDisruptionBudget

Protect your deployment with PDB:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: exercise-pdb
  namespace: default
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
EOF
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get pdb exercise-pdb
```

**Expected Output:**

```
NAME           MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
exercise-pdb   2               N/A               1                     5s
```

### Exercise 4: Configure Graceful Shutdown

Add preStop hook to your deployment:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment task-api -n default --patch '
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 45
      containers:
        - name: task-api
          lifecycle:
            preStop:
              exec:
                command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 10"]
'
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get deployment task-api -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds}'
```

**Expected Output:**

```
45
```

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `traffic-engineer` skill in Lesson 0. Based on what you learned about resilience patterns:

### Which Patterns Should ALWAYS Be Included?

| Pattern | Always Include? | Reason |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| **PDB** | Yes | Zero cost, prevents maintenance outages |
| **Graceful shutdown** | Yes | Prevents dropped requests during deploy |
| **Readiness probe** | Yes | Prevents traffic to unready pods |
| **Request timeout** | Yes | Prevents resource exhaustion |
| **Retries** | Almost always | Handles transient failures automatically |

### Which Patterns Are Situational?

| Pattern | When to Include | When to Skip |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Liveness probe** | Complex apps that can deadlock | Simple stateless apps |
| **Outlier detection** | Multi-replica deployments | Single replica |
| **Startup probe** | Slow-starting apps (>30s) | Fast-starting apps |
| **Per-retry timeout** | With retry policy | Without retries |

### Add Resilience Templates to Your Skill

**Retry policy template:**

```yaml
# Template: retry-policy
retry:
  numRetries: {{ retries | default(3) }}
  perRetry:
    backOff:
      baseInterval: {{ base_interval | default("100ms") }}
      maxInterval: {{ max_interval | default("2s") }}
    timeout: {{ per_retry_timeout | default("500ms") }}
  retryOn:
    httpStatusCodes: [502, 503, 504]
    triggers: [connect-failure, retriable-status-codes]
```

**PDB template:**

```yaml
# Template: pdb
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: {{ service }}-pdb
  namespace: {{ namespace }}
spec:
  minAvailable: {{ min_available | default(2) }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ service }}
```

**Graceful shutdown template:**

```yaml
# Template: graceful-shutdown
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: {{ grace_period | default(45) }}
lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep {{ prestop_sleep | default(10) }}"]
```

### Update Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom | Check | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Requests fail during deploy | preStop hook configured? | Missing graceful shutdown |
| All pods evicted at once | PDB exists? | Missing PodDisruptionBudget |
| Slow requests never complete | Request timeout set? | No timeout configured |
| Transient errors reach users | Retry policy configured? | Missing retry configuration |
| Traffic to unready pods | Readiness probe configured? | Missing readiness probe |

## Try With AI

### Generate Resilience Configuration

Ask your traffic-engineer skill:

```
Using my traffic-engineer skill, generate a complete resilience configuration
for my Task API that includes:

- Retry policy: 3 retries with 100ms-2s exponential backoff
- Request timeout: 30 seconds
- PDB: minimum 2 pods available
- Graceful shutdown: 45 second grace period with 10 second preStop
```

**What you're learning:** AI generates multiple resilience patterns. Review the output—did AI include all four components? Are the retry and timeout values consistent (per-retry timeout &lt; request timeout)?

### Evaluate and Refine

Check AI's output for common issues:

- Does retry policy include `retryOn` conditions?
- Is `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` greater than preStop sleep + expected request duration?
- Does PDB selector match your deployment labels?

If something is missing:

```
The retry policy should only retry on 502, 503, 504 status codes—not 500.
Please update retryOn.httpStatusCodes.
```

### Add Health Probes

Extend to include health probes:

```
Now add liveness and readiness probe configuration to my deployment:

- Liveness: HTTP GET /healthz, check every 10s, 3 failures to restart
- Readiness: HTTP GET /ready, check every 5s, 2 failures to remove from rotation
- Startup: HTTP GET /healthz, allow 2 minutes for startup
```

**What you're learning:** AI generates probe configuration. Verify the timing makes sense—startup probe should allow enough time, liveness should not be too aggressive.

### Validate Complete Configuration

Before applying:

```bash
# Validate all resources
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f resilience-config.yaml

# Check for conflicts
kubectl get pdb -A | grep task-api
kubectl get backendtrafficpolicy -n task-api
```

This iteration—specifying requirements, evaluating output, validating before apply—produces production-ready resilience configurations.

### Safety Note

Resilience patterns interact with each other. Aggressive retries with long timeouts can cause request amplification during outages. Start with conservative settings: lower retry counts (2-3), shorter timeouts (10-30s), and longer backoff intervals (100ms-2s). Monitor your services during incident simulations before production deployment.
