# Traefik Ingress Controller

The previous lesson explained why Ingress has limitations—annotation chaos, vendor lock-in, no role separation. Gateway API solves these problems, but it introduces new abstractions: GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, BackendTrafficPolicy. That's a lot to absorb before routing your first request.

What if you just want external traffic reaching your Task API in 5 minutes?

Traefik offers exactly that. It's a simpler ingress controller with its own CRDs (IngressRoute, Middleware) that are more intuitive than Ingress annotations. You'll understand traffic routing fundamentals faster with Traefik, which prepares you for Gateway API's more powerful—but more complex—model.

This lesson gets your Task API accessible from outside the cluster with rate limiting protection. Then you'll understand exactly what Gateway API improves upon.

---

## Installing Traefik with Helm

Traefik publishes a Helm chart that handles all the complexity—Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount, RBAC, CRDs. You just run two commands.

Add the Traefik Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add traefik https://traefik.github.io/charts
```

**Output:**

```
"traefik" has been added to your repositories
```

Update repository information:

```bash
helm repo update
```

**Output:**

```
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "traefik" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```

Install Traefik in its own namespace:

```bash
helm install traefik traefik/traefik -n traefik --create-namespace
```

**Output:**

```
NAME: traefik
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 30 10:15:00 2024
NAMESPACE: traefik
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Traefik Proxy v3.2.0 has been deployed successfully on traefik namespace!
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n traefik
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
traefik-7d9c8f6c5b-xk2m9   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

Check the Service created by Traefik:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n traefik
```

**Output:**

```
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
traefik   LoadBalancer   10.96.45.123   localhost     80:31234/TCP,443:32456/TCP   45s
```

On Docker Desktop, `localhost` appears as the external IP. On a cloud provider, you'd see a real public IP. Either way, Traefik now accepts traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

## Understanding Traefik Architecture

Before creating routes, understand how Traefik processes requests:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**EntryPoints**: Ports where Traefik accepts connections. The Helm chart creates `web` (port 80) and `websecure` (port 443) by default.

**Routers**: Rules that match incoming requests. When a request matches a Router's rule (e.g., `Host('api.example.com') && PathPrefix('/tasks')`), Traefik sends it to the associated Service.

**Middlewares**: Transformations applied before reaching the backend. Rate limiting, authentication, header manipulation, path stripping—all are Middlewares.

**Services**: Backend targets. In Kubernetes, these point to Kubernetes Services that forward to Pods.

This is similar to Gateway API's model (Gateway, HTTPRoute, BackendTrafficPolicy) but with different terminology and simpler CRDs.

---

## Creating Your First IngressRoute

Traefik's `IngressRoute` CRD replaces Kubernetes' `Ingress` resource with a cleaner syntax. No annotations required.

First, ensure your Task API is running. If you've been following along, you have it deployed:

```bash
kubectl get svc task-api -n task-api
```

**Output:**

```
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
task-api   ClusterIP   10.96.78.234   <none>        8000/TCP   2h
```

Now create `task-api-ingressroute.yaml` that routes `/api/v1/tasks` to the Task API:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-route
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web  # Listen on port 80
  routes:
    - match: PathPrefix(`/api/v1/tasks`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: task-api
          port: 8000
```

**Output:**

(This is the manifest—we'll apply it next)

Apply the IngressRoute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-ingressroute.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
ingressroute.traefik.io/task-api-route created
```

Test the route:

```bash
curl http://localhost/api/v1/tasks
```

**Output:**

```json
{"tasks": []}
```

Your Task API is now accessible from outside the cluster through Traefik. The request flow:

1. Request arrives at `localhost:80` (Traefik's `web` EntryPoint)
2. Traefik matches `PathPrefix('/api/v1/tasks')` → `task-api-route`
3. Traefik forwards to `task-api:8000` in the `task-api` namespace
4. Task API responds, Traefik returns the response

Compare this to the Ingress resource from Lesson 1. No annotations needed. The routing logic is in structured YAML fields, not string annotations.

---

## Understanding the Match Rule Syntax

Traefik's match rules use a simple expression language:

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `Host('api.example.com')` | Match requests with this Host header |
| `PathPrefix('/api')` | Match paths starting with /api |
| `Path('/health')` | Match exactly /health |
| `Headers('X-Version', '2')` | Match requests with this header value |
| `Method('POST')` | Match only POST requests |
| `&&` | AND - both conditions must match |
| `||` | OR - either condition matches |

**Examples:**

Route only POST requests to /tasks:

```yaml
routes:
  - match: PathPrefix(`/api/v1/tasks`) && Method(`POST`)
    kind: Rule
    services:
      - name: task-api
        port: 8000
```

Route based on API version header:

```yaml
routes:
  - match: PathPrefix(`/api`) && Headers(`X-API-Version`, `v2`)
    kind: Rule
    services:
      - name: task-api-v2
        port: 8000
```

This expressive matching is something standard Ingress cannot do without controller-specific annotations.

---

## Adding Rate Limiting with Middleware

Your AI agent's Task API could be expensive to run. Without rate limiting, a single user could exhaust your compute budget. Traefik Middlewares handle this.

Create `ratelimit-middleware.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: rate-limit
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  rateLimit:
    average: 10      # 10 requests per second average
    burst: 20        # Allow bursts up to 20 requests
    period: 1s       # Time window
```

**Output:**

(This is the manifest—we'll apply it next)

Apply the Middleware:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ratelimit-middleware.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
middleware.traefik.io/rate-limit created
```

Now attach the Middleware to your IngressRoute. Create `task-api-ingressroute-ratelimited.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-route
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
  routes:
    - match: PathPrefix(`/api/v1/tasks`)
      kind: Rule
      middlewares:
        - name: rate-limit  # Attach the Middleware
      services:
        - name: task-api
          port: 8000
```

Apply the updated IngressRoute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-ingressroute-ratelimited.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
ingressroute.traefik.io/task-api-route configured
```

Test the rate limit by sending many requests quickly:

```bash
for i in {1..25}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost/api/v1/tasks
done
```

**Output:**

```
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
200
429
429
429
429
429
```

After approximately 20 requests (the burst limit), Traefik returns `429 Too Many Requests`. The rate limiter is protecting your backend.

---

## Path Manipulation with Middlewares

Sometimes your backend expects a different path than what external clients use. Middlewares can transform paths.

### StripPrefix Middleware

Remove a path prefix before forwarding. Create `strip-prefix-middleware.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: strip-api-prefix
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  stripPrefix:
    prefixes:
      - /api/v1
```

**Output:**

(Manifest only)

If a client requests `/api/v1/tasks`, Traefik forwards `/tasks` to the backend. Useful when your internal services don't expect version prefixes.

### AddPrefix Middleware

Add a path prefix before forwarding. Create `add-prefix-middleware.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: add-internal-prefix
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  addPrefix:
    prefix: /internal
```

**Output:**

(Manifest only)

A request to `/tasks` becomes `/internal/tasks` when reaching the backend.

### Headers Middleware

Add or modify HTTP headers. Create `headers-middleware.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: custom-headers
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  headers:
    customRequestHeaders:
      X-Forwarded-By: "traefik"
      X-Real-IP: ""  # Empty string removes the header
    customResponseHeaders:
      X-Served-By: "task-api-cluster"
```

**Output:**

(Manifest only)

### Chaining Multiple Middlewares

Apply multiple Middlewares in sequence:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-route
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
  routes:
    - match: PathPrefix(`/api/v1/tasks`)
      kind: Rule
      middlewares:
        - name: rate-limit       # Applied first
        - name: strip-api-prefix  # Applied second
        - name: custom-headers    # Applied third
      services:
        - name: task-api
          port: 8000
```

Middlewares execute in order. Rate limiting happens before path stripping, which happens before header modification.

---

## Enabling the Traefik Dashboard

Traefik includes a web dashboard for monitoring routes, services, and middlewares. Enable it by upgrading the Helm release:

```bash
helm upgrade traefik traefik/traefik -n traefik \
  --set dashboard.enabled=true \
  --set ingressRoute.dashboard.enabled=true
```

**Output:**

```
Release "traefik" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: traefik
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 30 10:45:00 2024
NAMESPACE: traefik
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
```

Access the dashboard via port-forward:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n traefik svc/traefik 9000:9000
```

**Output:**

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9000 -> 9000
Forwarding from [::1]:9000 -> 9000
```

Open `http://localhost:9000/dashboard/` in your browser. You'll see:

- **HTTP Routers**: Your IngressRoutes and their status
- **HTTP Services**: Backend services Traefik knows about
- **HTTP Middlewares**: All Middleware resources
- **EntryPoints**: Ports Traefik is listening on

The dashboard updates in real-time. Create a new IngressRoute, and it appears within seconds. This visibility is valuable for debugging routing issues.

## When to Use Traefik vs Gateway API

Both Traefik and Gateway API solve the same problem—routing external traffic to internal services. The choice depends on your situation.

### Use Traefik When:

| Scenario | Why Traefik |
|----------|-------------|
| Quick development/staging setup | Install → route in 5 minutes |
| Team already knows Traefik | Existing expertise reduces learning curve |
| Don't need cross-vendor portability | Traefik CRDs are Traefik-only |
| Simpler configuration preferred | IngressRoute is more intuitive than Gateway API |
| Need dashboard out of the box | Built-in visualization |

### Use Gateway API When:

| Scenario | Why Gateway API |
|----------|-----------------|
| Production with potential vendor changes | GatewayClass swap without route rewrites |
| Need role separation (platform vs app team) | Gateway owned by platform, HTTPRoute by apps |
| Want CNCF-standard portability | Industry standard, multiple implementations |
| Need advanced traffic splitting, mirroring | Native support vs Traefik-specific CRDs |
| Enterprise compliance requirements | Standard API easier to audit |

### Decision Table

| Question | Traefik | Gateway API |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Time to first route? | Minutes | 30+ minutes (install controller + CRDs) |
| Vendor lock-in? | Yes (Traefik CRDs) | No (standard API) |
| Role separation? | Limited | Built-in (GatewayClass/Gateway/HTTPRoute) |
| Learning curve? | Lower | Higher |
| Advanced features? | Via Middlewares | Via BackendTrafficPolicy |
| Multi-cluster? | Possible | Better supported |

**For this book's learning path**: We teach Traefik first because it's faster to understand. Once you've internalized traffic routing concepts with Traefik, Gateway API's abstractions will make more sense. Lessons 3-11 will then teach Gateway API as your production solution.

---

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Install Traefik and Access Dashboard

If you haven't already:

1. Install Traefik with Helm
2. Enable the dashboard
3. Access the dashboard at `localhost:9000/dashboard/`

Verify you can see EntryPoints, Routers, Services, and Middlewares sections.

### Exercise 2: Create IngressRoute for Task API

Create an IngressRoute that:
- Listens on EntryPoint `web`
- Matches path `/api/v1/tasks`
- Routes to the `task-api` Service on port 8000

Test with `curl http://localhost/api/v1/tasks`.

### Exercise 3: Add Rate Limiting Middleware

1. Create a Middleware with:
   - `average: 5` requests per second
   - `burst: 10` requests
2. Attach it to your IngressRoute
3. Test by sending 15 requests quickly

Verify you see `429` responses after the burst limit.

### Exercise 4: Add StripPrefix Middleware

1. Create a StripPrefix Middleware that removes `/api/v1`
2. Chain it with your rate limit Middleware
3. Verify the order matters: rate limiting should happen first

Check the Traefik dashboard to see both Middlewares attached to your route.

---

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `traffic-engineer` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Update Your Skill's Decision Logic

Your skill should now include Traefik as an option:

**When should your skill recommend Traefik?**
- Development/staging environments needing quick setup
- Teams already using Traefik
- Simpler configuration requirements
- Need built-in dashboard for monitoring

**When should your skill recommend Gateway API?**
- Production environments requiring vendor portability
- Multi-team setups needing role separation
- Advanced traffic patterns (splitting, mirroring)
- CNCF compliance requirements

### What Traefik Patterns Are Worth Encoding?

Consider adding these to your skill:

1. **Standard IngressRoute template** with EntryPoints and match rules
2. **Rate limiting Middleware** with configurable average/burst
3. **Middleware chaining pattern** (rate limit → strip prefix → headers)
4. **Dashboard enablement** for development clusters

Your skill should generate the appropriate CRDs based on whether Traefik or Gateway API is chosen.
