# Deploying Kafka with Strimzi

You've built the mental model of Kafka architecture. Now it's time to run a real cluster.

In production Kubernetes environments, you don't manually configure Kafka brokers. You use an **operator**—a Kubernetes-native controller that understands Kafka's operational requirements and manages the cluster lifecycle automatically. The industry standard for Kafka on Kubernetes is **Strimzi**, a CNCF project with widespread adoption.

This lesson walks you through deploying Kafka on Docker Desktop Kubernetes using Strimzi. By the end, you'll have a running Kafka cluster that you can use throughout this chapter.

## Docker Desktop Configuration

Before starting, configure Docker Desktop with enough resources for Kafka:

1. Open **Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources**
2. Configure based on your machine:

| Your Machine RAM | Docker Desktop Memory | Docker Desktop CPUs | Swap |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------|
| 8GB | 5GB | 4 | 1GB |
| 16GB | 8GB | 4 | 1GB |
| 32GB+ | 12GB+ | 6+ | 2GB |

3. Click **Apply & Restart**

Without this, Kafka pods will crash with `OOMKilled` or `CrashLoopBackOff` errors.

## Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, verify your environment is ready:

```bash
# Check Docker Desktop Kubernetes is running
kubectl cluster-info
```

**Output:**
```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

```bash
# Check Helm is installed
helm version
```

**Output:**
```
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.16.3", GitCommit:"...", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.22.7"}
```

If either command fails, revisit Chapters 49-51 to set up Docker Desktop Kubernetes and Helm.

## Understanding Operators and CRDs

Before diving into Strimzi, let's clarify two Kubernetes concepts you'll use throughout this lesson.

### What's a CRD?

Kubernetes has built-in resources like Pods and Services. A **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)** extends Kubernetes with new resource types:

| Built-in Resources | Custom Resources (after Strimzi) |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `kubectl get pods` | `kubectl get kafka` |
| `kubectl get services` | `kubectl get kafkatopic` |
| `kubectl get deployments` | `kubectl get kafkauser` |

CRDs let you manage Kafka the same way you manage any Kubernetes resource—with `kubectl apply -f`.

### What's an Operator?

An **operator** is a Kubernetes-specific pattern: a program that watches your CRDs and takes action to make reality match your desired state.

```
You apply YAML → Operator sees it → Operator creates/manages resources
        ↑                                      |
        └──────── Continuous loop ─────────────┘
```

Think of it as a **24/7 expert** encoded in software. A Kafka operator knows how to deploy, scale, upgrade, and heal Kafka clusters automatically. Without an operator, you'd write hundreds of lines of YAML and handle all operations manually.

## What is Strimzi?

**Strimzi** is a CNCF open-source project that provides a Kafka operator for Kubernetes. When you install Strimzi, it:

1. **Registers CRDs** — Teaches Kubernetes what `Kafka`, `KafkaTopic`, `KafkaUser` resources are
2. **Runs an operator** — A controller that watches those CRDs and manages actual Kafka clusters

Instead of writing complex deployment manifests, you describe your Kafka cluster declaratively, and Strimzi handles the operational complexity.

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Cluster Operator** | Watches Kafka CRDs and manages broker lifecycle |
| **Entity Operator** | Contains Topic Operator and User Operator |
| **Topic Operator** | Syncs KafkaTopic CRDs to actual Kafka topics |
| **User Operator** | Manages KafkaUser CRDs and credentials |

The operator pattern means you declare intent ("I want a 3-broker Kafka cluster") and Strimzi figures out how to achieve and maintain it.

## Step 1: Install Strimzi Operator

Add the Strimzi Helm repository and install the operator:

```bash
# Add Strimzi Helm repository
helm repo add strimzi https://strimzi.io/charts/
helm repo update
```

**Output:**
```
"strimzi" has been added to your repositories
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "strimzi" chart repository
Update Complete. Happy Helming!
```

```bash
# Create namespace for Kafka resources
kubectl create namespace kafka
```

**Output:**
```
namespace/kafka created
```

```bash
# Install Strimzi operator
helm install strimzi-kafka-operator strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator \
  --namespace kafka
```

**Output:**
```
NAME: strimzi-kafka-operator
LAST DEPLOYED: [timestamp]
NAMESPACE: kafka
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Thank you for installing strimzi-kafka-operator-0.49.1
```

## Step 2: Verify Operator is Running

Wait for the operator pod to be ready:

```bash
# Watch operator pod status
kubectl get pods -n kafka -w
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
strimzi-cluster-operator-6d4f5c5b9d-x7j2k   1/1     Running   0          45s
```

Press `Ctrl+C` once you see `1/1 Running`. The operator is now watching for Kafka CRDs.

## Understanding the Two-File Pattern

Before creating files, understand what we're about to build. Strimzi uses two CRDs that work together:

| File | CRD Type | What It Defines |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `kafka-nodepool.yaml` | KafkaNodePool | **The machines** — how many nodes, their roles, storage |
| `kafka-cluster.yaml` | Kafka | **The cluster config** — Kafka version, listeners, settings |

**Why two files?** Think of it like building a car:

- **KafkaNodePool** = "I want 1 engine that does both driving and steering" (hardware)
- **Kafka** = "Here's how to configure the car" (software settings)

**What happens when you apply each:**

```
Step 3: kubectl apply -f kafka-nodepool.yaml
        └─ Strimzi: "Got it, storing node specification. Waiting for cluster..."
           (Nothing runs yet)

Step 4: kubectl apply -f kafka-cluster.yaml
        └─ Strimzi: "Now I have both! Creating:"
           → Pod: task-events-dual-role-0 (actual Kafka broker)
           → Service: task-events-kafka-bootstrap (client connection point)
           → Entity Operator (manages topics/users)
```

The files are linked by name—the NodePool references which Kafka cluster it belongs to:

```yaml
# In kafka-nodepool.yaml
labels:
  strimzi.io/cluster: task-events  # ← Links to Kafka named "task-events"

# In kafka-cluster.yaml
metadata:
  name: task-events  # ← The name referenced above
```

Now let's create each file.

## Step 3: Create KafkaNodePool (Dual-Role for Development)

Kafka in KRaft mode has two node roles: **controllers** (manage metadata) and **brokers** (handle messages). For development, we combine both roles in a single node to minimize resource usage.

Create a file named `kafka-nodepool.yaml`:

```yaml
# kafka-nodepool.yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaNodePool
metadata:
  name: dual-role
  namespace: kafka
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: task-events
spec:
  replicas: 1
  roles:
    - controller
    - broker
  storage:
    type: ephemeral  # Use persistent-claim for production
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 512Mi   # Works on 8GB machines
      cpu: 200m
    limits:
      memory: 1Gi     # Increase to 2Gi for 16GB+ machines
      cpu: 500m
```

**Key configuration points:**

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `replicas` | 1 | Single node for development (use 3+ for production) |
| `roles` | controller, broker | Combined roles save resources in dev |
| `storage.type` | ephemeral | Data lost on restart (use persistent-claim for production) |
| `resources` | requests/limits | Memory and CPU allocation for stability |
| `strimzi.io/cluster` | task-events | Links this pool to the Kafka cluster |

Apply the node pool:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kafka-nodepool.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
kafkanodepool.kafka.strimzi.io/dual-role created
```

## Step 4: Create Kafka Cluster (KRaft Mode)

Now create the Kafka cluster that uses the node pool. Create a file named `kafka-cluster.yaml`:

```yaml
# kafka-cluster.yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: task-events
  namespace: kafka
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/node-pools: enabled
    strimzi.io/kraft: enabled
spec:
  kafka:
    version: 4.1.1
    metadataVersion: 4.1-IV0
    listeners:
      - name: plain
        port: 9092
        type: internal
        tls: false
      - name: external
        port: 9094
        type: nodeport
        tls: false
        configuration:
          bootstrap:
            nodePort: 30092
          brokers:
            - broker: 0
              nodePort: 30093
              advertisedHost: localhost   # Required for Docker Desktop
              advertisedPort: 30093
    config:
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
      default.replication.factor: 1
      min.insync.replicas: 1
      auto.create.topics.enable: false  # Production best practice
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
```

**Key configuration points:**

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `strimzi.io/kraft: enabled` | - | Uses KRaft mode (no ZooKeeper) |
| `strimzi.io/node-pools: enabled` | - | Uses KafkaNodePool for node config |
| `version` | 4.1.1 | Kafka version (requires Strimzi 0.49+) |
| `metadataVersion` | 4.1-IV0 | KRaft metadata format version |
| `listeners.plain` | port 9092, internal | For pod-to-pod communication inside K8s |
| `listeners.external` | nodeport 30092, advertisedHost: localhost | For your local machine to connect (Docker Desktop) |
| `replication.factor: 1` | - | Single replica for dev (use 3 for production) |
| `auto.create.topics.enable` | false | Prevents accidental topic creation |
| `entityOperator` | topicOperator, userOperator | Enable declarative topic/user management |

Apply the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kafka-cluster.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
kafka.kafka.strimzi.io/task-events created
```

## Step 5: Wait for Cluster Ready

The Strimzi operator will now create the Kafka pods. This takes 1-2 minutes on first deployment:

```bash
# Watch all Kafka-related pods
kubectl get pods -n kafka -w
```

**Output (after ~90 seconds):**
```
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
strimzi-cluster-operator-6d4f5c5b9d-x7j2k   1/1     Running   0          5m
task-events-dual-role-0                     1/1     Running   0          90s
task-events-entity-operator-7f4d8b9c-2kj3l  2/2     Running   0          45s
```

Press `Ctrl+C` once all pods show `Running`.

Verify the Kafka cluster status:

```bash
kubectl get kafka -n kafka
```

**Output:**
```
NAME          DESIRED KAFKA REPLICAS   DESIRED ZK REPLICAS   READY   METADATA STATE   WARNINGS
task-events   1                                              True    KRaft
```

The `READY: True` and `METADATA STATE: KRaft` confirm your cluster is operational.

## Step 6: Create Topics via KafkaTopic CRD

With the Entity Operator running, you can manage topics declaratively. Create a file named `kafka-topic.yaml`:

```yaml
# kafka-topic.yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: task-created
  namespace: kafka
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: task-events
spec:
  partitions: 3
  replicas: 1
  config:
    retention.ms: "604800000"  # 7 days
    cleanup.policy: delete
```

**Key configuration points:**

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `partitions` | 3 | Parallel processing units (scale consumers up to 3) |
| `replicas` | 1 | Single copy for dev (use 3 for production) |
| `retention.ms` | 604800000 | Keep messages for 7 days |
| `cleanup.policy` | delete | Remove old segments (vs "compact" for changelogs) |

Apply the topic:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kafka-topic.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
kafkatopic.kafka.strimzi.io/task-created created
```

Verify the topic was created:

```bash
kubectl get kafkatopics -n kafka
```

**Output:**
```
NAME           CLUSTER       PARTITIONS   REPLICATION FACTOR   READY
task-created   task-events   3            1                    True
```

## How Topic Operator Works

The Topic Operator watches for KafkaTopic resources and syncs them to the actual Kafka cluster:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You apply YAML                                             │
│    └─ kubectl apply -f kafka-topic.yaml                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Kubernetes API stores KafkaTopic CR                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Topic Operator watches and detects new CR                  │
│    └─ Creates topic in Kafka cluster                        │
│    └─ Updates CR status (READY: True)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Topic exists in Kafka, managed via GitOps                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This declarative approach means your topic configuration is version-controlled and reproducible across environments.

## Verify Kafka is Accessible

Test connectivity by running a temporary pod with the Kafka CLI:

```bash
# Start a temporary pod with Kafka tools
kubectl run kafka-test -n kafka --rm -it \
  --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:0.49.1-kafka-4.1.1 \
  --restart=Never \
  -- bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server task-events-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --list
```

**Output:**
```
task-created
```

This confirms:
1. The Kafka broker is accepting connections
2. The `task-events-kafka-bootstrap` service routes to the broker
3. The `task-created` topic exists

## Understanding the Bootstrap Service

Strimzi creates a Kubernetes Service for client connections:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n kafka | grep bootstrap
```

**Output:**
```
task-events-kafka-bootstrap   ClusterIP   10.96.45.123   <none>   9091/TCP,9092/TCP,9093/TCP   5m
```

Clients connect to `task-events-kafka-bootstrap:9092` (or port 9093 for TLS). This service load-balances across all broker pods, providing a stable endpoint regardless of pod restarts.

## Development vs Production Configuration

The configuration in this lesson is optimized for learning on Docker Desktop. Production requires different settings:

| Setting | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Node pool replicas | 1 | 3+ (controller: 3, broker: 3+) |
| Storage type | ephemeral | persistent-claim |
| Replication factor | 1 | 3 |
| min.insync.replicas | 1 | 2 |
| Separate controller pool | No (dual-role) | Yes |

Lesson 18 covers production Strimzi configuration in detail.

## Cleanup (Optional)

If you need to remove the Kafka cluster:

```bash
# Delete in reverse order
kubectl delete kafkatopic task-created -n kafka
kubectl delete kafka task-events -n kafka
kubectl delete kafkanodepool dual-role -n kafka
helm uninstall strimzi-kafka-operator -n kafka
kubectl delete namespace kafka
```

For now, keep the cluster running—you'll use it in the remaining lessons.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `kafka-events` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my kafka-events skill, generate a Strimzi Kafka Custom Resource for a development cluster on Docker Desktop.
Does my skill produce valid Kafka CRDs with KRaft mode configuration?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include Strimzi operator deployment patterns?
- Did it explain the difference between KRaft mode and ZooKeeper mode?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My kafka-events skill is missing Strimzi deployment patterns (Kafka CRDs, KRaft vs ZooKeeper).
Update it to include how to deploy production-ready Kafka on Kubernetes using Strimzi.
```

## Try With AI

You've deployed Kafka using Strimzi's operator pattern. Now explore how this fits into broader infrastructure decisions.

**Production Configuration Review**

```
I just deployed Kafka on Docker Desktop Kubernetes using Strimzi with:
- Single node (dual-role: controller + broker)
- Ephemeral storage
- Replication factor 1

Review my configuration for production readiness:
1. What specific changes would I need for a production deployment?
2. For a 3-broker production cluster, what would the KafkaNodePool
   and Kafka CRDs look like?
3. What monitoring should I add to detect problems before they
   cause outages?
```

**What you're learning:** Production Kafka requires careful sizing and redundancy configuration. AI can help you understand the gap between development convenience and production reliability.

**Debugging Operator Issues**

```
My Strimzi operator is running but my Kafka cluster isn't becoming ready.
kubectl get kafka shows READY: False.

Help me debug:
1. What logs should I check first?
2. What are common reasons Kafka clusters fail to start?
3. How do I interpret Strimzi's status conditions?
```

**What you're learning:** Operators provide status information through CRD conditions. Understanding how to read operator status helps you debug declarative infrastructure.

**Alternative Topic Configurations**

```
I created a topic with partitions: 3 and replicas: 1.

Help me understand:
1. How do I decide how many partitions a topic needs?
2. What's the relationship between partitions and consumer scaling?
3. When should I use cleanup.policy: compact vs delete?
```

**What you're learning:** Topic configuration directly impacts performance and semantics. The right settings depend on your use case—high-throughput streaming vs change data capture vs event sourcing.

**Safety note:** When modifying production Kafka configurations, always test changes in a staging environment first. Incorrect replication or partition settings can cause data loss.
