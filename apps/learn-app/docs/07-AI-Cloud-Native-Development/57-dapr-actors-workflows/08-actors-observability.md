# Actors Observability

Your ChatAgent actors are running in production. Users are chatting. State is persisting. Everything looks fine. Then someone asks: "Why did user-456's conversation take 3 seconds to respond yesterday at 14:32?"

You check the application logs. Nothing unusual. You check the pod status. All healthy. You check Redis. Data is there. But you can't see *inside* the actor method call. You can't trace the request from HTTP endpoint through actor activation through state store operation. You're debugging blind.

This is the observability gap. Without distributed tracing, you see individual components but not the flow between them. Without metrics, you know something is slow but not which actors or which methods. Without systematic debugging, you're guessing.

Dapr's observability features close this gap. In this lesson, you'll configure OpenTelemetry tracing to follow requests through actor method calls, deploy Prometheus to collect actor metrics, and learn debugging strategies that turn "it's slow somewhere" into "the ProcessMessage method on ChatAgent is slow due to state store latency."

## The Observability Stack for Actors

Dapr integrates with three observability pillars:

| Pillar | What It Captures | Tool | Question It Answers |
|--------|------------------|------|---------------------|
| **Tracing** | Request flow across services and actors | Zipkin, Jaeger | "What path did this request take and where did it slow down?" |
| **Metrics** | Counters, gauges, histograms over time | Prometheus | "How many actor activations happened? What's the average method duration?" |
| **Logging** | Structured event records | Stdout (JSON) | "What happened in sequence? What were the parameters?" |

For actor debugging, tracing and metrics are most powerful. Tracing shows you the *flow*; metrics show you the *patterns*.

## Configuring Tracing with OpenTelemetry

Dapr uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. You configure it once in a Dapr Configuration resource, and every actor method call automatically generates spans.

### Step 1: Deploy Jaeger

Jaeger collects and visualizes traces. Deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
# kubernetes/jaeger.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jaeger
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jaeger
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jaeger
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: jaeger
          image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 16686  # UI
            - containerPort: 4317   # OTLP gRPC
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jaeger
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 16686
      targetPort: 16686
      name: ui
    - port: 4317
      targetPort: 4317
      name: otlp
  selector:
    app: jaeger
```

**Output after applying:**
```
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/jaeger.yaml
deployment.apps/jaeger created
service/jaeger created

$ kubectl get pods -l app=jaeger
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jaeger-7d9f8c6b4-x2k9j    1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### Step 2: Configure Dapr Tracing

Create a Dapr Configuration that enables OpenTelemetry export to Jaeger:

```yaml
# components/observability.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: observability
  namespace: default
spec:
  tracing:
    samplingRate: "1"  # 100% sampling for development; reduce in production
    otel:
      endpointAddress: "jaeger:4317"
      isSecure: false
      protocol: grpc
  metrics:
    enabled: true
```

The key settings:

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `samplingRate` | "1" | Trace 100% of requests (use "0.1" for 10% in production) |
| `endpointAddress` | "jaeger:4317" | Where to send traces (Jaeger's OTLP gRPC port) |
| `protocol` | grpc | Use gRPC for efficient trace export |
| `metrics.enabled` | true | Enable Prometheus metrics endpoint |

### Step 3: Apply Configuration to Your Deployment

Your actor service must reference this configuration. Update your deployment annotations:

```yaml
# kubernetes/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: chat-agent-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "chat-agent-service"
        dapr.io/app-port: "8000"
        dapr.io/config: "observability"  # Reference the Configuration
        dapr.io/log-level: "info"
        dapr.io/log-as-json: "true"      # Structured logging
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: chat-agent
          image: chat-agent:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
```

The critical annotation is `dapr.io/config: "observability"`. This tells Dapr to apply the tracing and metrics configuration to this service's sidecar.

### Step 4: View Actor Traces

After deploying, generate some actor activity:

```bash
# Invoke ChatAgent methods
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat/user1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "user", "content": "Hello there"}'

curl http://localhost:8000/chat/user1/history
```

Open Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`. Select service `chat-agent-service` and find traces:

**What you see in the trace:**

```
chat-agent-service: POST /chat/user1
├── chat-agent-service: actor/ChatAgent/user1/method/ProcessMessage
│   ├── chat-agent-service: state/get
│   └── chat-agent-service: state/set
└── Response: 200 OK (45ms)
```

Each actor method call creates a span. State store operations appear as child spans. You can see exactly where time was spent.

**Output in Jaeger UI (simplified):**
```
Trace ID: 4bf92f3577b34da6
Service: chat-agent-service
Duration: 45ms

Spans:
  [45ms] POST /chat/user1
    [38ms] actor/ChatAgent/user1/method/ProcessMessage
      [12ms] state/get (statestore)
      [8ms] state/set (statestore)
```

## Collecting Actor Metrics with Prometheus

While tracing shows individual requests, metrics show patterns over time. Prometheus scrapes metrics from Dapr sidecars.

### Step 1: Deploy Prometheus

```yaml
# kubernetes/prometheus.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: prometheus
          image: prom/prometheus:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9090
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /etc/prometheus
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: prometheus-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
  namespace: default
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'dapr'
      static_configs:
      - targets: ['chat-agent-service-dapr:9090']
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 9090
      targetPort: 9090
  selector:
    app: prometheus
```

**Output after applying:**
```
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prometheus.yaml
deployment.apps/prometheus created
configmap/prometheus-config created
service/prometheus created
```

### Step 2: Query Actor Metrics

Open Prometheus UI at `http://localhost:9090`. Query these actor-specific metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | Example Query |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| `dapr_actor_invocations_total` | Total actor method calls | `dapr_actor_invocations_total{actor_type="ChatAgent"}` |
| `dapr_actor_pending_calls` | Calls waiting in actor queue | `dapr_actor_pending_calls{actor_type="ChatAgent"}` |
| `dapr_actor_operation_duration_seconds` | Method execution time | `histogram_quantile(0.95, dapr_actor_operation_duration_seconds_bucket)` |
| `dapr_actor_active_count` | Currently activated actors | `dapr_actor_active_count{actor_type="ChatAgent"}` |

**Example Prometheus Query Output:**

```
# Query: dapr_actor_invocations_total{actor_type="ChatAgent"}
{actor_type="ChatAgent", app_id="chat-agent-service", method="ProcessMessage"} 142
{actor_type="ChatAgent", app_id="chat-agent-service", method="GetConversationHistory"} 58

# Query: dapr_actor_active_count{actor_type="ChatAgent"}
{actor_type="ChatAgent", app_id="chat-agent-service"} 23
```

This tells you: 23 ChatAgent instances are currently active, with 142 ProcessMessage calls and 58 GetConversationHistory calls.

### Step 3: Identify Performance Patterns

Use metrics to answer operational questions:

**"Which methods are slowest?"**
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  rate(dapr_actor_operation_duration_seconds_bucket{actor_type="ChatAgent"}[5m])
) by (method)
```

**Output:**
```
{method="ProcessMessage"} 0.045    # 95th percentile: 45ms
{method="GetConversationHistory"} 0.012  # 95th percentile: 12ms
```

**"Are actors accumulating?"**
```promql
increase(dapr_actor_active_count{actor_type="ChatAgent"}[1h])
```

If active count keeps increasing without decreasing, actors aren't being garbage-collected (check idle timeout configuration).

## Debugging Actor Issues

When something goes wrong with actors, use this systematic approach:

### Issue 1: Actor Not Receiving Calls

**Symptoms:** Requests to actor methods return 404 or timeout.

**Debugging checklist:**

1. **Check actor registration:**
```bash
# Verify actor types registered with Dapr
curl http://localhost:3500/v1.0/metadata | jq '.actors'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "ChatAgent",
    "count": 5
  }
]
```

If your actor type isn't listed, it's not registered. Check your startup code.

2. **Check sidecar logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c daprd | grep -i actor
```

**Look for:**
```
level=info msg="actor runtime started. actor idle timeout: 1h0m0s"
level=info msg="registered actor type: ChatAgent"
```

3. **Verify app-id matches:**
Your actor proxy must use the correct app-id. If deployment has `dapr.io/app-id: "chat-agent-service"`, your proxy must target that ID.

### Issue 2: Actor Method Timeouts

**Symptoms:** Actor calls hang or timeout after default 60 seconds.

**Debugging approach:**

1. **Find slow spans in Jaeger:**
   - Search for traces with duration > 10s
   - Identify which child span (state operation, external call) is slow

2. **Check turn-based concurrency:**
```promql
dapr_actor_pending_calls{actor_type="ChatAgent"}
```

If pending calls are high (> 10), the actor is processing slowly and requests are queuing. This is expected with turn-based concurrency but indicates the actor is overloaded.

3. **Check state store latency:**
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95, dapr_state_latency_seconds_bucket{component="statestore"})
```

High state store latency affects all actor operations.

### Issue 3: Actor State Not Persisting

**Symptoms:** Actor loses state after deactivation/reactivation.

**Debugging approach:**

1. **Verify state store configuration:**
```bash
kubectl get components statestore -o yaml
```

**Check for:**
```yaml
metadata:
  - name: actorStateStore
    value: "true"  # Must be "true" for actors
```

2. **Inspect state in Redis:**
```bash
kubectl exec -it redis-0 -- redis-cli
> KEYS *ChatAgent*
> GET "chat-agent-service||ChatAgent||user1||history"
```

If keys exist, state is persisting. If not, check StateManager calls in your actor code.

3. **Check `_on_activate` initialization:**
Ensure you're using `try_get_state`, not `get_state`, to handle first activation:

```python
async def _on_activate(self) -> None:
    found, state = await self._state_manager.try_get_state("data")
    if not found:
        # Initialize only if no existing state
        await self._state_manager.set_state("data", default_value)
```

## Complete Observability Setup

Here's a Tiltfile that deploys the full observability stack:

```python
# Tiltfile
load('ext://helm_remote', 'helm_remote')
load('ext://nerdctl', 'nerdctl_build')

# Build your actor service
nerdctl_build(
    ref='chat-agent',
    context='.',
    dockerfile='Dockerfile',
)

# Deploy Dapr via Helm
helm_remote(
    chart='dapr',
    repo_url='https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/',
    release_name='dapr',
    namespace='dapr-system',
    create_namespace=True,
)

# Deploy Redis, Dapr components, and your service
k8s_yaml([
    'components/statestore.yaml',
    'components/observability.yaml',
    'kubernetes/jaeger.yaml',
    'kubernetes/prometheus.yaml',
    'kubernetes/deployment.yaml',
])

# Port forwards for UIs
k8s_resource('jaeger', port_forwards='16686:16686')
k8s_resource('prometheus', port_forwards='9090:9090')
k8s_resource('chat-agent-service', port_forwards='8000:8000')
```

**After `tilt up`, you have:**
- Your actor service at http://localhost:8000
- Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686
- Prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090

## Dapr Dashboard for Quick Inspection

For quick actor inspection without querying Prometheus, use Dapr Dashboard:

```bash
dapr dashboard
```

Navigate to **Actors** tab to see:
- Registered actor types
- Active instance count per type
- Actor configuration (idle timeout, drain timeout)

This is faster than Prometheus for "How many ChatAgent instances are active right now?"

## Reflect on Your Skill

Your `dapr-deployment` skill should now include observability configuration. Test it:

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my dapr-deployment skill, configure observability for my actor system.
I need:
- Traces exported to Jaeger
- Prometheus metrics enabled
- JSON-formatted logging

Generate the Dapr Configuration YAML and the deployment annotations I need.
```

Does your skill produce:
- Complete observability Configuration with tracing and metrics?
- Correct deployment annotations including `dapr.io/config` reference?
- JSON logging annotation for structured log parsing?

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Can my skill explain what `samplingRate: "1"` means and when to change it?
- Does it know the key actor metrics (`dapr_actor_invocations_total`, `dapr_actor_active_count`)?
- Can it generate Prometheus queries for actor performance analysis?

### Improve Your Skill

If gaps exist:

```
My dapr-deployment skill needs better observability coverage. Update it to include:
- OpenTelemetry tracing configuration with Jaeger endpoint
- The key actor metrics and what they indicate
- Debugging checklist for common actor issues (not receiving calls, timeouts, state loss)
- Sample Prometheus queries for actor performance analysis
```

## Try With AI

Open your AI companion and explore actor observability scenarios.

### Prompt 1: Configure Tracing for Your Actors

```
Help me configure Dapr tracing for my actor system. I have ChatAgent actors
running on Kubernetes and I want to:
1. See traces for every actor method call
2. Include state store operations as child spans
3. Export to Jaeger running in my cluster

Show me:
- The Dapr Configuration YAML I need
- How to reference it in my deployment
- What I'll see in Jaeger UI after invoking an actor method

Also explain: what does samplingRate do and why would I set it to "0.1" in production?
```

**What you're learning**: How to configure distributed tracing end-to-end. The AI helps you understand the relationship between Configuration, deployment annotations, and what appears in the tracing UI.

### Prompt 2: Diagnose Slow Actor Performance

```
My ChatAgent actors are responding slowly. Average response time jumped from
50ms to 500ms yesterday. I have Prometheus and Jaeger set up.

Walk me through a systematic debugging approach:
1. What Prometheus queries should I run first?
2. What should I look for in Jaeger traces?
3. How do I determine if the issue is:
   - Actor method logic
   - State store latency
   - Turn-based concurrency (request queueing)
   - Network/sidecar overhead

Give me specific queries and what the results would indicate.
```

**What you're learning**: Systematic performance debugging using observability data. The AI guides you through the diagnostic workflow, connecting metrics and traces to root causes.

### Prompt 3: Set Up Alerting for Actor Health

```
I want to be notified when my actor system has problems. Help me design
Prometheus alerting rules for:
1. Actor method duration exceeding 200ms (95th percentile)
2. Active actor count exceeding 1000 (possible memory leak)
3. Pending calls queue exceeding 50 (actor overload)
4. Actor type not registered (deployment issue)

Show me the Prometheus alerting rules and explain what conditions trigger each.
```

**What you're learning**: Proactive monitoring with alerting. The AI helps you translate operational concerns into actionable alerting rules that catch problems before users report them.

### Safety Note

Tracing and metrics add overhead. With `samplingRate: "1"` (100% tracing), every request generates trace data. In high-throughput production systems, this can impact performance and storage. Start with 100% sampling during development, then reduce to 10% or 1% in production. Monitor the observability system itself: if Jaeger or Prometheus can't keep up, you'll lose visibility when you need it most.
