# Dapr Workflows Overview

Your ChatActor works beautifully for maintaining conversation state. But what happens when you need to process a task that spans hours or days? A customer onboarding flow that waits for document verification. An order fulfillment process that coordinates inventory, payment, and shipping. A multi-step AI analysis pipeline that should resume exactly where it stopped if the server restarts.

Actors excel at stateful entities with identity. But long-running orchestration across multiple services—where you need retries, timeouts, parallel execution, and rollback on failure—calls for a different pattern.

This is where Dapr Workflows shine.

## Why Workflows Matter for AI Agents

Imagine you're building an AI agent that processes research requests. The workflow looks like:

1. **Validate** the research query
2. **Search** multiple knowledge bases in parallel
3. **Synthesize** results using an LLM
4. **Wait** for human approval if confidence is low
5. **Deliver** the final report

Each step might take minutes. The human approval step might take days. What happens if your server restarts between steps 3 and 4?

Without workflows, you'd lose everything. The user would need to start over. With Dapr Workflows, the process resumes exactly where it stopped—the search results are preserved, and the workflow continues waiting for human approval.

This is **durable execution**: your business logic survives infrastructure failures.

## Durable Execution: The Core Concept

Traditional code runs in memory. When the process dies, everything is lost:

```
Traditional Execution:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  step1() → step2() → [SERVER CRASH] → ??? (lost forever)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Durable execution persists progress at each step:

```
Durable Execution:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  step1() → ✓checkpoint → step2() → ✓checkpoint → [CRASH]   │
│                                                              │
│  [RESTART] → replay → replay → step3() → ✓checkpoint → ... │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each checkpoint records what happened. On restart, the workflow engine **replays** the history to reconstruct state, then continues from where it left off.

### Event Sourcing: How Checkpoints Work

Dapr Workflows use **event sourcing** to persist progress. Instead of storing "current state," they store "sequence of events that led to current state."

When your workflow calls an activity:

```
Event 1: ActivityScheduled(validate_task, input={task_id: "123"})
Event 2: ActivityCompleted(validate_task, result={valid: true})
Event 3: ActivityScheduled(assign_task, input={task_id: "123"})
Event 4: ActivityCompleted(assign_task, result={assignee: "alice"})
[CRASH HERE]
```

On restart, the workflow engine:

1. Reads the event history from the state store
2. **Replays** the workflow code, but skips actual execution—it returns cached results from history
3. Reaches the point where history ends (after Event 4)
4. **Resumes** normal execution from there

This is why checkpointing is called "durable"—the state store (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) persists across restarts.

## The Workflow Engine Architecture

Dapr Workflows run on the **Durable Task Framework**, the same foundation used by Azure Durable Functions. Here's how the pieces fit together:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        Your Application                          │
│  ┌────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Workflow Runtime  │    │  Activities (Units of Work)      │  │
│  │  - Orchestrates    │────│  - Can call external APIs        │  │
│  │  - Manages replay  │    │  - Can be non-deterministic      │  │
│  └─────────┬──────────┘    │  - Results are cached            │  │
│            │                └─────────────────────────────────┘  │
└────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
             │ gRPC Stream
┌────────────▼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Dapr Sidecar                                │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │  Workflow Engine (Built on Actor Backend)                   │ │
│  │  - Stores workflow history as events                        │ │
│  │  - Handles replay and resumption                            │ │
│  │  - Manages timers and external events                       │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                              │                                    │
└──────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┘
                               │
┌──────────────────────────────▼────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     State Store (Redis, etc.)                     │
│              Workflow history persisted as events                 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: Dapr Workflows use the actor backend for state storage. This means:
- Workflow state gets the same persistence guarantees as actor state
- You need `actorStateStore: "true"` in your state store configuration
- Workflows and actors share infrastructure, but serve different purposes

## The Critical Rule: Workflow Determinism

Here's where many developers get confused—and where bugs become subtle and hard to debug.

**Workflow code must be deterministic.** Every time the workflow replays, it must make the same decisions in the same order. Otherwise, replay produces a different execution path than the original, and the workflow engine can't match history events to code execution.

### What Breaks Determinism

These patterns cause replay failures:

| Pattern | Why It Breaks | What Happens on Replay |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| `random.randint(1, 100)` | Different value each run | Workflow takes different branch than history recorded |
| `datetime.now()` | Different time on replay | Timeout logic behaves differently |
| `httpx.get(url)` | External API state may change | Can't guarantee same response |
| `os.environ["CONFIG"]` | Environment may differ | Configuration changes break replay |
| `uuid.uuid4()` | Different ID each run | Can't match to history |

### What Workflows Can Do Safely

| Pattern | Why It's Safe |
|---------|---------------|
| `ctx.current_utc_datetime` | Workflow context provides deterministic time |
| `yield ctx.call_activity(...)` | Activity results are cached in history |
| `yield ctx.create_timer(...)` | Timer is recorded in history |
| `ctx.wait_for_external_event(...)` | Event data is recorded in history |
| Input parameters | Same input produces same execution |

### The Mental Model

Think of it this way:

- **Workflow code** = orchestration logic that must replay identically
- **Activity code** = actual work that can do anything (results get cached)

If you need to call an API, generate a random number, or get the current time—do it in an activity. The activity's result gets stored in history, and on replay, the workflow receives that cached result instead of re-executing.

```python
# WRONG: Non-deterministic in workflow
def my_workflow(ctx, input_data):
    if random.random() > 0.5:  # Different on each replay!
        yield ctx.call_activity(path_a, input=input_data)
    else:
        yield ctx.call_activity(path_b, input=input_data)

# CORRECT: Determinism through activity
def my_workflow(ctx, input_data):
    decision = yield ctx.call_activity(make_decision, input=input_data)
    if decision["path"] == "a":
        yield ctx.call_activity(path_a, input=input_data)
    else:
        yield ctx.call_activity(path_b, input=input_data)

# The activity can use random, datetime, APIs - it only runs once
def make_decision(ctx, input_data):
    return {"path": "a" if random.random() > 0.5 else "b"}
```

## When to Use Workflows vs Actors vs Plain State

This is the question every Dapr developer faces. Here's the decision framework:

### Comparison Table

| Characteristic | Plain State | Actors | Workflows |
|----------------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Identity** | Key-based lookup | Encapsulated per entity | Per workflow instance |
| **Concurrency** | Manual locking needed | Turn-based (automatic) | Sequential per workflow |
| **Durability** | Manual checkpointing | Automatic state persistence | Automatic event sourcing |
| **Scheduling** | External (cron, etc.) | Timers & Reminders | Built-in timers |
| **Multi-step orchestration** | Manual tracking | Possible but awkward | Native pattern |
| **Parallel execution** | Manual coordination | Actor-to-actor calls | `when_all`, `when_any` |
| **Compensation/Rollback** | Manual implementation | Manual implementation | Saga pattern support |
| **Long-running (hours/days)** | Complex | Reminders help | Designed for this |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Polling | Possible | `wait_for_external_event` |

### Decision Framework

**Use Plain State When:**
- Simple key-value storage needs
- No concurrency concerns
- No multi-step processes
- Example: Storing user preferences, caching responses

**Use Actors When:**
- Entity has identity (user, session, device)
- Turn-based concurrency matters (chat messages must process in order)
- State needs timers/reminders (deadline notifications)
- Multiple independent entities (10,000 users each with their own state)
- Example: `ChatActor` for conversation history, `UserSessionActor` for login state

**Use Workflows When:**
- Multi-step process that must complete reliably
- Need parallel execution with aggregation
- Need compensation on failure (undo completed steps)
- Long-running processes (hours to days)
- Human approval or external events required
- Example: Order fulfillment, document processing pipeline, AI research synthesis

### Real-World Mapping

| Scenario | Best Choice | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Chat conversation history | **Actor** | Entity with identity, turn-based message processing |
| Order processing (reserve → pay → ship) | **Workflow** | Multi-step orchestration, compensation on failure |
| User preference storage | **Plain State** | Simple key-value, no orchestration |
| Research pipeline (search → analyze → approve) | **Workflow** | Long-running, human-in-the-loop, parallel search |
| Session timeout tracking | **Actor** | Entity with timer/reminder needs |
| Batch document processing | **Workflow** | Parallel execution, fan-out/fan-in pattern |
| Real-time game state | **Actor** | High-frequency updates, entity identity |
| Customer onboarding flow | **Workflow** | Multi-step, external events (document verification) |

### The Hybrid Pattern: Actors + Workflows

Often the best architecture combines both:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TaskProcessingWorkflow (orchestration)                         │
│  ┌────────────┐    ┌────────────┐    ┌────────────┐            │
│  │ Validate   │ -> │ Process    │ -> │ Notify     │            │
│  │ Activity   │    │ Activity   │    │ Activity   │            │
│  └────────────┘    └─────┬──────┘    └────────────┘            │
│                          │                                      │
│                          ▼                                      │
│                    ┌────────────┐                               │
│                    │ TaskActor  │ (entity state)                │
│                    │ - status   │                               │
│                    │ - history  │                               │
│                    │ - reminder │                               │
│                    └────────────┘                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Workflow** handles the multi-step orchestration
- **Actor** maintains the entity's state with identity
- Workflow activities call actor methods to update state
- Actor reminders handle entity-specific scheduling (deadlines)

This separation lets each pattern do what it does best.

## Reflect on Your Skill

Does your `dapr-deployment` skill understand when to recommend workflows versus actors? Test it:

```
Using my dapr-deployment skill, I have a customer onboarding process:
1. Collect documents (immediate)
2. Verify identity (external service, may take 2 days)
3. Create account (if verified)
4. Send welcome email (after account created)
5. If verification fails, notify customer and clean up partial state

Should this be an actor, a workflow, or both? Explain your reasoning.
```

If your skill recommends a workflow with compensation logic for the failure case, it understands the pattern. If it suggests putting everything in an actor or plain state, consider adding workflow decision criteria to your skill.

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Explore Durable Execution Mechanics

```
I'm learning about Dapr Workflows and durable execution. Walk me through
exactly what happens when:

1. A workflow with 3 activities (A, B, C) completes activity B
2. The server crashes before activity C starts
3. The server restarts

Show me the event history that gets stored, and explain the replay process
step by step. Use a concrete example like an order processing workflow.
```

**What you're learning:** The mechanics of event sourcing and replay—understanding that workflow history is a sequence of events, not a snapshot of state.

### Prompt 2: Identify Determinism Violations

```
Here's a workflow I wrote. Help me identify any determinism violations
and explain why each one would cause replay failures:

def process_task_workflow(ctx, task):
    # Get current time for logging
    start_time = datetime.utcnow()

    # Randomly select a processing strategy
    if random.choice(['fast', 'thorough']) == 'fast':
        result = yield ctx.call_activity(fast_process, input=task)
    else:
        result = yield ctx.call_activity(thorough_process, input=task)

    # Check external config
    config = os.environ.get('PROCESSING_MODE', 'default')

    # Generate unique ID for the result
    result['id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())

    return result

For each violation, show me the correct pattern using activities.
```

**What you're learning:** How to audit workflow code for determinism issues and the pattern of moving non-deterministic operations into activities.

### Prompt 3: Design Decision Framework Application

```
I'm building an AI agent system with these requirements:

1. Users submit research queries
2. System searches 3 knowledge bases in parallel
3. LLM synthesizes results (may take 30 seconds)
4. If confidence < 80%, wait for human review (may take days)
5. Deliver final report
6. Track each user's query history for personalization

Walk me through your decision process: What should be an actor?
What should be a workflow? What should be plain state?
Create a diagram showing how the components interact.
```

**What you're learning:** Applying the actors vs workflows decision framework to a realistic scenario, including hybrid patterns where both are needed.

**Safety Note:** When implementing workflows in production, always test your replay behavior by actually killing and restarting the workflow service mid-execution. Determinism bugs only surface during replay, and they can be subtle—the workflow might run fine normally but fail mysteriously on restart.
