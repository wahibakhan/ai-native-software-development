# Writing Your First Dockerfile

In Lesson 2, you pulled images from Docker Hub and ran containers. Those images were built by someone else. Now you'll write your own blueprint—a Dockerfile—and build a custom image for your Task API.

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand exactly what happens when Docker reads each line of your Dockerfile, why instruction order matters for build speed, and how to create images that build fast and run reliably.

---

## Setup: Create the Task API Project

You'll containerize the In-Memory Task API from Chapter 40. Let's create it fresh using UV:

```bash
uv init task-api && cd task-api
```

**Output:**
```
Initialized project `task-api` at `/Users/you/task-api`
```

Add FastAPI with all standard dependencies:

```bash
uv add "fastapi[standard]"
```

**Output:**
```
Resolved 23 packages in 156ms
Prepared 23 packages in 1.2s
Installed 23 packages in 89ms
 + annotated-types==0.7.0
 + anyio==4.7.0
 + click==8.1.8
 + fastapi==0.115.6
 + uvicorn==0.34.0
 ...
```

Now replace the contents of `main.py` with the Task API:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="Task API")


class Task(BaseModel):
    id: int | None = None
    title: str
    completed: bool = False


tasks: list[Task] = []
next_id = 1


@app.post("/tasks", response_model=Task)
def create_task(task: Task) -> Task:
    global next_id
    task.id = next_id
    next_id += 1
    tasks.append(task)
    return task


@app.get("/tasks", response_model=list[Task])
def list_tasks() -> list[Task]:
    return tasks


@app.get("/tasks/{task_id}", response_model=Task)
def get_task(task_id: int) -> Task:
    for task in tasks:
        if task.id == task_id:
            return task
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Task not found")


@app.get("/health")
def health_check() -> dict:
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

Test that it runs locally:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open a new terminal and verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Output:**
```
{"status":"healthy"}
```

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`. Your API works locally—now let's containerize it.

---

## What Is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a **text file containing instructions** that tell Docker how to build an image. Think of it as a recipe:

- A **recipe** lists ingredients and steps to make a dish
- A **Dockerfile** lists a base environment and steps to create an image

When you run `docker build`, Docker reads your Dockerfile line by line, executing each instruction to construct an image.

### What a Dockerfile Produces

```
Dockerfile (your instructions)
        ↓
    docker build
        ↓
    Image (frozen environment)
        ↓
    docker run
        ↓
    Container (running instance)
```

The Dockerfile doesn't run your application. It creates an **image**—a frozen snapshot containing your code, dependencies, and configuration. When you `docker run` that image, you get a live container.

### How Docker Reads a Dockerfile

Docker processes your Dockerfile **top to bottom**, one instruction at a time:

1. Each instruction creates a **layer** (a snapshot of the filesystem at that point)
2. Layers stack on top of each other
3. The final stack of layers = your image
4. Docker caches layers—if an instruction hasn't changed, Docker reuses the cached layer

This layered approach is why Docker builds are fast after the first time: unchanged layers don't rebuild.

### The Six Essential Instructions

| Instruction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `FROM` | Start from a base image (the foundation) |
| `WORKDIR` | Set the working directory inside the container |
| `COPY` | Copy files from your machine into the image |
| `RUN` | Execute a command during build (install packages) |
| `EXPOSE` | Document which port the application uses |
| `CMD` | Define the default command when container starts |

You'll use all six in your Dockerfile. Let's write it instruction by instruction.

---

## Writing the Dockerfile: Line by Line

Create a new file named `Dockerfile` (no extension):

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Open it in your editor. We'll build it one instruction at a time.

### Instruction 1: FROM

Every Dockerfile starts with `FROM`. This specifies your **base image**—the starting environment.

Add this line:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
```

**What this does:**
- `FROM` tells Docker: "Start with this pre-built image"
- `python:3.12-slim` is an official Python image with minimal OS (~130 MB)
- The image comes from Docker Hub (where you pulled `nginx:alpine` in Lesson 2)

**Why `slim`?** The `slim` variant includes only what's needed to run Python. The full `python:3.12` image is ~900 MB with build tools you don't need for this application.

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
```

### Instruction 2: Install UV Package Manager

UV is a modern Python package manager—10-100x faster than pip. We'll copy it from its official image:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/
```

**What this does:**
- `COPY --from=` is a multi-stage copy—it pulls binaries from another image
- `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest` is UV's official image
- `/uv` and `/uvx` are the UV binaries
- `/bin/` places them in the system PATH

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/
```

### Instruction 3: WORKDIR

Set where your application will live inside the container:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

**What this does:**
- Creates `/app` directory if it doesn't exist
- Sets it as the working directory for all subsequent instructions
- All `COPY` and `RUN` commands now execute relative to `/app`

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app
```

### Instruction 4: COPY Dependencies

Copy your dependency file into the image:

```dockerfile
COPY pyproject.toml .
```

**What this does:**
- Copies `pyproject.toml` from your machine (the build context)
- Places it in `/app` (current WORKDIR)
- The `.` means "current directory inside the container"

**Why copy this first?** Layer caching. Dependencies change rarely; code changes often. By copying dependencies first, Docker can cache the installed packages layer and reuse it when only your code changes.

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml .
```

### Instruction 5: RUN (Install Packages)

Now install the dependencies:

```dockerfile
RUN uv sync --no-dev
```

**What this does:**
- `RUN` executes a command **during image build**
- `uv sync` reads `pyproject.toml` and installs all dependencies
- `--no-dev` skips development dependencies (pytest, mypy, etc.)
- Creates a layer containing all installed packages

**Important distinction:**
- `RUN` executes during **build** (creates a layer in the image)
- `CMD` executes when **container starts** (doesn't create a layer)

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN uv sync --no-dev
```

### Instruction 6: COPY Application Code

Now copy your actual application:

```dockerfile
COPY main.py .
```

**What this does:**
- Copies `main.py` into `/app`
- This is the code that changes frequently

**Why copy this AFTER dependencies?** When you edit `main.py` and rebuild:
1. Docker sees that `pyproject.toml` hasn't changed
2. Docker reuses the cached layer with installed packages
3. Only this `COPY main.py` layer rebuilds
4. **Build time: ~1 second** instead of 30+ seconds

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN uv sync --no-dev

COPY main.py .
```

### Instruction 7: EXPOSE

Document which port your application uses:

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8000
```

**What this does:**
- Documents that the container listens on port 8000
- Does NOT actually open the port—that happens with `-p` at runtime
- Useful as documentation and for orchestrators like Kubernetes

Your Dockerfile so far:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN uv sync --no-dev

COPY main.py .

EXPOSE 8000
```

### Instruction 8: CMD

Finally, tell Docker what command to run when the container starts:

```dockerfile
CMD ["uv", "run", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

**What this does:**
- `CMD` specifies the default startup command
- `uv run` executes in the UV-managed environment
- `uvicorn main:app` starts the ASGI server with your FastAPI app
- `--host 0.0.0.0` binds to all interfaces (required for container networking)
- `--port 8000` matches the EXPOSE instruction

**Why `0.0.0.0`?** Inside a container, `localhost` (127.0.0.1) is isolated. Using `0.0.0.0` makes the service accessible when you map ports with `-p`.

### Complete Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN uv sync --no-dev

COPY main.py .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uv", "run", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Save the file.

---

## Building Your Image

Now build an image from your Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t task-api:v1 .
```

**What the flags mean:**
- `docker build` reads the Dockerfile and builds an image
- `-t task-api:v1` tags the image with name `task-api` and version `v1`
- `.` specifies the build context (current directory)

**Output:**
```
[+] Building 45.2s (10/10) FINISHED

 + uvicorn==0.34.0
 ...
 => [6/5] COPY main.py .
 => exporting to image
 => => naming to docker.io/library/task-api:v1
```

Notice each step corresponds to an instruction in your Dockerfile. Docker executed them top to bottom, creating layers.

Verify the image exists:

```bash
docker images | grep task-api
```

**Output:**
```
task-api    v1    a1b2c3d4e5f6    30 seconds ago    195MB
```

Your image is ~195 MB—containing Python, UV, FastAPI, Uvicorn, and your application code.

---

## Running Your Container

Start a container from your image:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 task-api:v1
```

**What `-p 8000:8000` does:**
- Maps port 8000 on your machine (left) to port 8000 in the container (right)
- Your machine's port 8000 → container's port 8000
- Now `localhost:8000` on your machine reaches the container

**Output:**
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open a **new terminal** and test:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Output:**
```
{"status":"healthy"}
```

Create a task:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Learn Docker"}'
```

**Output:**
```
{"id":1,"title":"Learn Docker","completed":false}
```

Your containerized Task API works! Stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

---

## The .dockerignore File

When you run `docker build .`, Docker sends your entire directory to the build context. If you have:
- `.venv/` (500+ MB virtual environment)
- `__pycache__/` (bytecode)
- `.git/` (repository history)
- `.env` (secrets)

Docker wastes time processing these, and worse—secrets could end up in your image.

Create `.dockerignore`:

```
# Python artifacts
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/

# Virtual environments
.venv/
venv/

# UV cache
.uv/

# IDE files
.idea/
.vscode/

# Git
.git/
.gitignore

# Secrets
.env
.env.*
*.pem
*.key

# OS files
.DS_Store
```

Rebuild to verify it works:

```bash
docker build -t task-api:v2 .
```

The build should be faster since Docker isn't processing excluded files.

---

## Layer Caching in Action

Edit `main.py` to add a version endpoint:

```python
@app.get("/version")
def get_version() -> dict:
    return {"version": "1.0.0"}
```

Rebuild:

```bash
docker build -t task-api:v3 .
```

**Output:**
```
[+] Building 1.2s (10/10) FINISHED
 => CACHED [1/5] FROM docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim
 => CACHED [2/5] COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/
 => CACHED [3/5] WORKDIR /app
 => CACHED [4/5] COPY pyproject.toml .
 => CACHED [5/5] RUN uv sync --no-dev
 => [6/5] COPY main.py .
 => exporting to image
```

Notice `CACHED` for steps 1-5. Docker reused those layers because `pyproject.toml` didn't change. Only the `COPY main.py` step ran.

**Build time: ~1 second** instead of 45 seconds.

This is why instruction order matters:
- **Frequent changes** (your code) go at the **bottom**
- **Rare changes** (dependencies) go near the **top**

---

## Running with Options

### Different Host Port

Run on port 9000 instead:

```bash
docker run -p 9000:8000 task-api:v3
```

Test:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health
```

### Environment Variables

Pass configuration without changing the image:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e LOG_LEVEL=debug task-api:v3
```

Your application reads `os.environ["LOG_LEVEL"]` at runtime.

### Background Mode

Run without blocking your terminal:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-api task-api:v3
```

**Flags:**
- `-d` runs detached (background)
- `--name my-api` gives it a memorable name

Check status:

```bash
docker ps
```

Stop and remove:

```bash
docker stop my-api && docker rm my-api
```

---

## Common Build Errors

### "COPY: source file does not exist"

```
COPY pyproject.toml .
COPY: source file does not exist
```

**Cause:** File missing in build context.
**Fix:** Verify the file exists: `ls pyproject.toml`

### "Port already in use"

```
Bind for 0.0.0.0:8000 failed: port is already allocated
```

**Cause:** Another process using port 8000.
**Fix:** Use different port: `docker run -p 9000:8000 task-api:v1`

### Container Exits Immediately

Run without `-d` to see the error:

```bash
docker run task-api:v1
```

Or check logs:

```bash
docker logs $(docker ps -lq)
```

---

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Diagnose a Slow Build

```
My Docker builds take 60 seconds every time I change my code. Here's my
Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "main.py"]

What's wrong with my layer ordering? How would you fix it?
```

**What you're learning:** Analyzing layer cache invalidation—understanding how instruction order affects build performance.

### Prompt 2: Handle Build Dependencies

```
My Dockerfile build fails with:

error: Failed to build `pydantic-core==2.27.2`
  Caused by: Failed to build wheel

The package needs a Rust compiler. I'm using python:3.12-slim. What are my
options? Should I use a larger base image or try multi-stage builds?
```

**What you're learning:** Troubleshooting native compilation failures—a common challenge with Python packages that have binary dependencies.

### Prompt 3: Design for Your Own API

```
I'm building a [describe your API]. Based on the Task API Dockerfile pattern,
help me design my Dockerfile. Ask me:
1. What dependencies does it need?
2. Does it require any system packages?
3. What environment variables does it use?
4. Does it need to persist data?

Then write a Dockerfile with comments explaining each choice.
```

**What you're learning:** Applying Dockerfile patterns to your own applications—moving from following instructions to making design decisions.

### Safety Note

Never include secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials) in your Dockerfile or image. Use environment variables (`-e` flag) or Docker secrets at runtime. Images may be shared or pushed to registries where secrets would be exposed.

---

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `docker-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my docker-deployment skill, generate a Dockerfile for a FastAPI
application. Does it:
1. Use proper instruction ordering for layer caching?
2. Include UV for fast package installation?
3. Set WORKDIR and use 0.0.0.0 for the host?
```

### Identify Gaps

- Did your skill produce valid Dockerfiles?
- Did it handle layer caching correctly?
- Did it include .dockerignore patterns?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My docker-deployment skill needs better Dockerfile generation. Update it to:
1. Order instructions for optimal layer caching
2. Use UV instead of pip
3. Generate .dockerignore files
4. Document each instruction with comments
```
