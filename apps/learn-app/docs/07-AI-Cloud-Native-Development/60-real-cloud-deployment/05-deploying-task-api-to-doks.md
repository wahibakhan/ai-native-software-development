# Deploying Task API to DOKS

Your DOKS cluster is provisioned, kubectl is connected, and you understand DNS and Load Balancers. Now comes the moment you've been building toward: deploying your complete Task API stack to production infrastructure.

This isn't a single `kubectl apply` command. A production deployment involves multiple components that depend on each other. Dapr must exist before your application can use its sidecars. The Ingress controller must have an external IP before cert-manager can validate domain ownership. Certificates must be issued before HTTPS works.

The order matters. Get it wrong, and you'll spend hours debugging why pods are stuck in CrashLoopBackOff or why certificates show "pending" forever.

---

## The Deployment Sequence: Order Matters

Think of deploying to production like building a house. You can't install windows before framing the walls, and you can't run electricity before the walls are up. Cloud Kubernetes deployments follow the same logic:

```
Step 1: Dapr (distributed application runtime)
    │
    ▼
Step 2: Traefik Ingress Controller (receives traffic)
    │
    ▼
Step 3: cert-manager (issues TLS certificates)
    │
    ▼
Step 4: Task API Helm Release (your application)
    │
    ▼
Step 5: Verification (prove it works)
```

**Why this order?**

- **Dapr first**: Your Task API pods need Dapr sidecars injected. If Dapr isn't installed, pods fail to start.
- **Traefik second**: cert-manager needs an Ingress controller to handle HTTP-01 challenges. No Ingress = no certificate validation.
- **cert-manager third**: You want HTTPS from the start. Installing cert-manager before your app means certificates are ready when traffic arrives.
- **Task API last**: Now all dependencies exist. Your app deploys with sidecars, routes through Ingress, and serves over HTTPS.

---

## Step 1: Initialize Dapr on DOKS

Dapr provides service invocation, state management, and pub/sub for your Task API. On a cloud cluster, initialization is nearly identical to local—but the resources run on cloud nodes.

### Install Dapr CLI (if not already installed)

```bash
# macOS
brew install dapr/tap/dapr-cli

# Linux
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash
```

**Output:**
```
Dapr CLI installed successfully.
CLI version: 1.13.0
Runtime version: n/a
```

### Initialize Dapr on the Cluster

```bash
dapr init -k --wait
```

**Output:**
```
Making the jump to hyperspace...
Note: To install Dapr using Helm, see here: https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/#install-with-helm
Deploying the Dapr control plane to your cluster...
Success! Dapr has been installed to namespace dapr-system. To verify, run `dapr status -k`
```

### Verify Dapr Installation

```bash
dapr status -k
```

**Output:**
```
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.13.0   45s  2024-12-23 14:30:00
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.13.0   45s  2024-12-23 14:30:00
  dapr-placement-server  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.13.0   45s  2024-12-23 14:30:00
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.13.0   45s  2024-12-23 14:30:00
  dapr-dashboard         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.13.0   45s  2024-12-23 14:30:00
```

All five Dapr components are running. The sidecar-injector will automatically add Dapr sidecars to pods with the correct annotations.

---

## Step 2: Install Traefik Ingress Controller

Traefik will receive all incoming traffic and route it to your services. On DOKS, installing Traefik creates a DigitalOcean Load Balancer automatically.

### Add Traefik Helm Repository

```bash
helm repo add traefik https://traefik.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

**Output:**
```
"traefik" has been added to your repositories
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "traefik" chart repository
Update Complete.
```

### Install Traefik

```bash
helm install traefik traefik/traefik \
  --namespace traefik \
  --create-namespace \
  --set service.type=LoadBalancer
```

**Output:**
```
NAME: traefik
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 23 14:32:15 2024
NAMESPACE: traefik
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```

### Wait for External IP

The Load Balancer takes 2-3 minutes to provision. Wait for it:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n traefik --watch
```

**Output (after ~2 minutes):**
```
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
traefik   LoadBalancer   10.245.100.42   143.198.123.45   80:31024/TCP,443:30812/TCP   2m15s
```

When `EXTERNAL-IP` shows an IP address (not `<pending>`), your Load Balancer is ready. Note this IP—you'll need it for DNS.

### Configure DNS

Point your domain to the Load Balancer IP:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| A | tasks | 143.198.123.45 |
| A | *.tasks | 143.198.123.45 |

If you don't have a domain, use `nip.io` for testing: `tasks.143.198.123.45.nip.io` automatically resolves to that IP.

---

## Step 3: Install cert-manager

cert-manager automates TLS certificate issuance from Let's Encrypt. Once installed, it watches for Certificate resources and automatically obtains and renews certificates.

### Install cert-manager

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

**Output:**
```
NAME: cert-manager
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 23 14:35:22 2024
NAMESPACE: cert-manager
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```

### Verify cert-manager Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-7b8c5c5d5c-xb9j8              1/1     Running   0          45s
cert-manager-cainjector-6b8c5c5d5c-k2m4p   1/1     Running   0          45s
cert-manager-webhook-5b8c5c5d5c-j9n3l      1/1     Running   0          45s
```

### Create ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt

Create a file `letsencrypt-prod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-account-key
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: traefik
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f letsencrypt-prod.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-prod created
```

### Verify ClusterIssuer

```bash
kubectl get clusterissuer
```

**Output:**
```
NAME               READY   AGE
letsencrypt-prod   True    30s
```

`Ready: True` means cert-manager can communicate with Let's Encrypt.

---

## Step 4: Deploy Task API with Helm

Now deploy your Task API using the Helm chart from Chapter 51. Create a production values file that includes your domain and TLS configuration.

### Create Production Values File

Create `values-doks.yaml`:

```yaml
# Task API Production Configuration for DOKS
replicaCount: 2

image:
  repository: your-registry/task-api
  tag: "v1.0.0"
  pullPolicy: Always

# Enable Dapr sidecar injection
dapr:
  enabled: true
  appId: "task-api"
  appPort: 8000

service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 8000

# Ingress with TLS
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "traefik"
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: "websecure"
  hosts:
    - host: tasks.yourdomain.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
  tls:
    - secretName: task-api-tls
      hosts:
        - tasks.yourdomain.com

# Cloud-appropriate resources
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"

# Health checks
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5

# Environment configuration
env:
  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    value: "INFO"
  - name: ENVIRONMENT
    value: "production"
```

### Deploy Task API

```bash
helm install task-api ./task-api-chart \
  -f values-doks.yaml \
  --namespace default
```

**Output:**
```
NAME: task-api
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 23 14:40:33 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```

### Wait for Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods --watch
```

**Output:**
```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
task-api-6f8c5c5d5c-abc12   2/2     Running   0          45s
task-api-6f8c5c5d5c-def34   2/2     Running   0          45s
```

Notice `2/2` READY—that's your application container plus the Dapr sidecar.

---

## Step 5: Verify the Complete Stack

### Check Certificate Status

```bash
kubectl get certificate
```

**Output:**
```
NAME           READY   SECRET         AGE
task-api-tls   True    task-api-tls   2m
```

`READY: True` means Let's Encrypt issued your certificate successfully.

If `READY` shows `False`, check the Certificate resource:

```bash
kubectl describe certificate task-api-tls
```

Look for events explaining why issuance failed (usually DNS not propagated or HTTP challenge failed).

### Check Ingress

```bash
kubectl get ingress
```

**Output:**
```
NAME       CLASS     HOSTS                  ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
task-api   traefik   tasks.yourdomain.com   143.198.123.45   80, 443   3m
```

### Test HTTPS Endpoint

```bash
curl https://tasks.yourdomain.com/health
```

**Output:**
```json
{"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

Your Task API is running on production infrastructure with:
- Dapr sidecar for distributed capabilities
- Traefik handling ingress traffic
- Let's Encrypt TLS certificate
- Cloud Load Balancer distributing traffic

### Full Stack Verification Commands

Run these to confirm everything is operational:

```bash
# Dapr components
dapr status -k

# Traefik with Load Balancer
kubectl get svc -n traefik

# cert-manager
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

# Certificate issued
kubectl get certificate

# Task API pods with sidecars
kubectl get pods

# Ingress routing
kubectl get ingress

# Final test
curl -v https://tasks.yourdomain.com/health
```

**Expected successful output pattern:**
```
< HTTP/2 200
< content-type: application/json
<
{"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

---

## What You've Deployed

Your production stack now includes:

| Component | Purpose | Namespace |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Dapr** | Service mesh, state, pub/sub | dapr-system |
| **Traefik** | Ingress controller, Load Balancer | traefik |
| **cert-manager** | Automatic TLS certificates | cert-manager |
| **Task API** | Your application with Dapr sidecar | default |

This is the same architecture pattern used by production AI services. The components are loosely coupled—you can upgrade Traefik without touching your application, or switch cert-manager issuers without redeploying.

---

## Common Issues and Diagnosis

### Certificate Stuck on "Pending"

**Symptom:**
```bash
kubectl get certificate
NAME           READY   SECRET         AGE
task-api-tls   False   task-api-tls   10m
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
kubectl describe certificate task-api-tls
kubectl get challenges
```

**Common causes:**
- DNS not propagated (wait 5 minutes, check with `dig tasks.yourdomain.com`)
- Ingress class mismatch (verify `traefik` in both ClusterIssuer and Ingress)
- HTTP-01 challenge failing (check Load Balancer firewall allows port 80)

### Pods Show 1/2 Ready

**Symptom:** Task API pods show `1/2` instead of `2/2`

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
kubectl logs task-api-xyz -c daprd
```

**Common causes:**
- Dapr not initialized (run `dapr init -k`)
- Missing Dapr annotations in deployment
- Dapr sidecar-injector not running

### No External IP on Load Balancer

**Symptom:** `kubectl get svc -n traefik` shows `<pending>` for EXTERNAL-IP

**Diagnosis:**
- Check DigitalOcean dashboard for Load Balancer quota
- Verify cluster has `--auto-upgrade` or correct DOKS version
- Check node capacity (Load Balancer needs healthy nodes)

---

## Try With AI

**Challenge**: Deploy your Task API to DOKS with the full production stack.

### Part 1: Deployment Planning

Open Claude Code in your project directory and ask:

```
I have a DOKS cluster running. Help me plan the deployment order
for Task API with Dapr, Traefik Ingress, and cert-manager TLS.
```

Record the deployment sequence AI suggests. Does it match the order in this lesson? Note any differences.

### Part 2: Configuration Review

AI will suggest default configurations. Evaluate them:

- Does the Helm values file include my domain?
- Is TLS enabled with Let's Encrypt production issuer?
- Are resource requests/limits appropriate for DOKS?

Tell AI your specific requirements:

```
My domain is tasks.example.com, I want production Let's Encrypt
certificates, and 512Mi memory limit for Task API pods.
```

Watch how AI adapts the configuration to your constraints.

### Part 3: Deployment Execution

Execute the deployment commands AI provides. Watch for:

- Dapr pods appearing in `dapr-system` namespace
- Traefik LoadBalancer getting `EXTERNAL-IP`
- cert-manager Certificate showing `Ready: True`

If any step fails, share the error with AI:

```
The Traefik service shows EXTERNAL-IP as <pending> after 5 minutes.
Here's kubectl describe svc traefik -n traefik output: [paste output]
```

### Part 4: Troubleshooting Together

If your certificate isn't issued after deployment:

```
My Certificate shows Ready: False. Here's the output of
kubectl describe certificate task-api-tls: [paste output]
```

Work through the diagnosis together. What did AI suggest checking? What did you discover about your configuration?

### Part 5: Verification

Test your production endpoint:

```bash
curl https://tasks.yourdomain.com/health
```

Ask yourself:
- What improved through iteration with AI?
- Which configuration details did you refine based on AI suggestions?
- What did you correct when AI made assumptions that didn't match your setup?

**Safety Note**: Never share API tokens, passwords, or other secrets in prompts. Configure secrets through Kubernetes Secrets, not environment variables in values files.

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `multi-cloud-deployer` skill against what you learned:

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my multi-cloud-deployer skill, generate a complete deployment
script for DOKS that includes Dapr, Traefik, cert-manager, and
a Helm application with TLS.
```

### Identify Gaps

Does your skill:
- Know the correct deployment order (Dapr -> Traefik -> cert-manager -> app)?
- Include wait commands between dependent components?
- Generate ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt?
- Add TLS annotations to Ingress configuration?

### Improve Your Skill

If gaps exist:

```
My multi-cloud-deployer skill is missing full stack deployment patterns.
Update it to include:
- Deployment sequence for DOKS (Dapr, Traefik, cert-manager)
- Wait commands between component installations
- ClusterIssuer configuration for Let's Encrypt
- Helm values with TLS annotations for Traefik Ingress
```

By the end of this chapter, your skill handles complete production deployments—not just cluster provisioning.
