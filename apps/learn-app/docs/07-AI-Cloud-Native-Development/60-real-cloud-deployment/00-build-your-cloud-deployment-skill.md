# Build Your Cloud Deployment Skill

Before learning real cloud deployment—provisioning Kubernetes clusters on DigitalOcean, Hetzner, and other providers—you'll **own** a multi-cloud deployment skill.

---

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

```bash
cd claude-code-skills-lab
claude
```

## Step 2: Create Your Skill

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for multi-cloud Kubernetes deployment.
I will use it to provision and manage K8s clusters on budget-friendly providers like
DigitalOcean (DOKS) and Hetzner (k3s via hetzner-k3s CLI). The skill should cover:

- DigitalOcean DOKS cluster provisioning with doctl
- Hetzner K3s cluster provisioning with hetzner-k3s CLI
- Multi-cloud portability (provision → connect → deploy pattern)
- Cost comparison and optimization strategies

Use context7 skill to study official documentation for doctl, hetzner-k3s, and kubectl.
Build it from official docs so no self-assumed knowledge.
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch official DigitalOcean and Hetzner documentation via Context7
2. Ask you clarifying questions (cluster size, node pools, cost thresholds)
3. Create the complete skill with CLI references and deployment templates

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/multi-cloud-deployer/`.

## Reflect on Your Skill

Your `multi-cloud-deployer` skill is now ready. Throughout this chapter, you'll:

1. **Test it** against real cloud scenarios (provisioning, connecting, deploying)
2. **Identify gaps** as you learn manual steps
3. **Improve it** by adding provider-specific patterns

After each lesson, return here to verify: *Does my skill handle what I just learned?*
