# Production Checklist & Verification

You've deployed your Task API to a cloud Kubernetes cluster. But deployed doesn't mean production-ready. A deployment can run without being resilient, observable, or secure.

This lesson gives you a systematic approach: a 10-point production readiness checklist that separates "it works on my cluster" from "it's ready for real traffic."

The pattern you'll learn here applies to any Kubernetes deployment—not just DigitalOcean, not just Task API. Once you internalize this checklist, you can verify any deployment on any cloud.

## Why Checklists Matter in Production

Airplane pilots use pre-flight checklists despite thousands of hours of experience. Surgeons use surgical checklists despite years of training. The reason? **Humans forget things under pressure, and production deployments happen under pressure.**

A deployment might fail silently in ways that only manifest under load:
- Health probes missing means Kubernetes can't restart failing pods
- Resource limits missing means one pod can starve others
- HPA missing means traffic spikes cause outages instead of scale-ups

The checklist catches these issues before customers do.

## The 10-Point Production Readiness Checklist

| # | Check | Command | Pass Criteria |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Health endpoint responds | `curl https://domain/health` | HTTP 200 |
| 2 | Resource limits set | `kubectl describe pod <pod>` | Limits visible |
| 3 | Replicas >= 2 | `kubectl get deploy` | READY shows 2+ |
| 4 | Liveness probe configured | `kubectl get deploy -o yaml` | livenessProbe present |
| 5 | Readiness probe configured | `kubectl get deploy -o yaml` | readinessProbe present |
| 6 | TLS certificate valid | `curl -v https://domain` | Certificate OK |
| 7 | Secrets not in env vars | `kubectl describe pod` | No sensitive values |
| 8 | Pod disruption budget | `kubectl get pdb` | PDB exists |
| 9 | HPA configured (if needed) | `kubectl get hpa` | HPA exists |
| 10 | Cost estimate documented | Provider dashboard | Monthly cost known |

Let's verify each item systematically.

## Check 1: Health Endpoint Responds

The health endpoint is your deployment's vital sign. If it doesn't respond, nothing else matters.

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://your-domain.com/health
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
200
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
000
```

A `000` response typically means DNS isn't resolving or the service isn't reachable. Check your Ingress and DNS configuration.

For more detail:

```bash
curl -v https://your-domain.com/health
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
< HTTP/2 200
< content-type: application/json
{"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}
```

**What you're verifying**: The entire path works—DNS resolves, Load Balancer routes, Ingress matches, Service forwards, Pod responds.

## Check 2: Resource Limits Set

Without resource limits, a single misbehaving pod can consume all node resources, crashing other workloads.

```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app=task-api | grep -A 5 "Limits:"
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
    Limits:
      cpu:     500m
      memory:  512Mi
    Requests:
      cpu:     100m
      memory:  256Mi
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
    Limits:
      <none>
    Requests:
      <none>
```

If you see `<none>`, add resource specifications to your deployment:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

**What you're verifying**: Kubernetes knows how much CPU and memory your pods need, enabling proper scheduling and preventing resource starvation.

## Check 3: Replicas >= 2

A single replica means zero redundancy. If that pod crashes or its node goes down, your service is unavailable.

```bash
kubectl get deploy task-api
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
NAME       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
task-api   2/2     2            2           1h
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
NAME       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
task-api   1/1     1            1           1h
```

Scale up if needed:

```bash
kubectl scale deploy task-api --replicas=2
```

**What you're verifying**: Your service survives the loss of any single pod or node.

## Check 4: Liveness Probe Configured

Liveness probes tell Kubernetes when to restart a stuck container. Without them, a deadlocked process runs forever.

```bash
kubectl get deploy task-api -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].livenessProbe}' | jq .
```

**Output (Pass):**
```json
{
  "httpGet": {
    "path": "/health",
    "port": 8000,
    "scheme": "HTTP"
  },
  "initialDelaySeconds": 10,
  "periodSeconds": 30,
  "timeoutSeconds": 5,
  "failureThreshold": 3
}
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
null
```

If missing, add to your deployment spec:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 30
  failureThreshold: 3
```

**What you're verifying**: Kubernetes will automatically restart containers that become unresponsive.

## Check 5: Readiness Probe Configured

Readiness probes tell Kubernetes when a pod is ready to receive traffic. Without them, traffic routes to pods still initializing.

```bash
kubectl get deploy task-api -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].readinessProbe}' | jq .
```

**Output (Pass):**
```json
{
  "httpGet": {
    "path": "/health",
    "port": 8000,
    "scheme": "HTTP"
  },
  "initialDelaySeconds": 5,
  "periodSeconds": 10,
  "timeoutSeconds": 3,
  "successThreshold": 1,
  "failureThreshold": 3
}
```

**What you're verifying**: Traffic only routes to pods that are fully initialized and ready to handle requests.

## Check 6: TLS Certificate Valid

HTTPS requires a valid, non-expired certificate. An invalid certificate breaks trust for browsers and API clients.

```bash
curl -v https://your-domain.com/health 2>&1 | grep -E "SSL|certificate"
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* Server certificate:
*  subject: CN=your-domain.com
*  start date: Dec 30 00:00:00 2025 GMT
*  expire date: Mar 30 23:59:59 2026 GMT
*  issuer: C=US; O=Let's Encrypt; CN=R11
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
* SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
* Closing connection
```

If using cert-manager, check certificate status:

```bash
kubectl get certificate
```

**Output:**
```
NAME              READY   SECRET            AGE
task-api-tls      True    task-api-tls      1h
```

**What you're verifying**: Your HTTPS endpoint is secure and trusted by clients.

## Check 7: Secrets Not in Environment Variables

Sensitive values should never appear in plain text when describing pods.

```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app=task-api | grep -E "(OPENAI|API_KEY|PASSWORD|SECRET)"
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
(no output - secrets aren't visible in describe output when using secretKeyRef)
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY:  sk-proj-abc123def456...
```

If secrets appear in plain text, refactor to use Kubernetes Secrets:

```yaml
env:
  - name: OPENAI_API_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: task-api-secrets
        key: openai-api-key
```

**What you're verifying**: Sensitive values aren't exposed in logs, kubectl output, or memory dumps.

## Check 8: Pod Disruption Budget Exists

PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) prevent Kubernetes from terminating too many pods during node maintenance.

```bash
kubectl get pdb
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
NAME              MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
task-api-pdb      1               N/A               1                     1h
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
No resources found in default namespace.
```

Create a PDB if missing:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: task-api-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
```

**What you're verifying**: Your service remains available during cluster upgrades and node maintenance.

## Check 9: HPA Configured (If Needed)

HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) scales pods based on CPU or memory usage.

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

**Output (Pass):**
```
NAME       REFERENCE             TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
task-api   Deployment/task-api   45%/80%   2         10        2          1h
```

**Output (Fail for traffic-receiving services):**
```
No resources found in default namespace.
```

For services expecting variable traffic, create an HPA:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: task-api
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: task-api
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

**What you're verifying**: Your service scales automatically under load instead of becoming unresponsive.

## Check 10: Cost Estimate Documented

Production readiness includes knowing what you're paying.

Access your cloud provider's dashboard:
- **DigitalOcean**: cloud.digitalocean.com > Billing
- **Hetzner**: console.hetzner.cloud > Cloud > Servers > monthly costs
- **AWS**: Cost Explorer
- **GCP**: Billing dashboard

Document:
- Current monthly cost
- Cost per component (nodes, load balancer, storage)
- Projected cost at 2x scale

**What you're verifying**: No surprises on your cloud bill.

## Common Failures and Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Health endpoint returns 503 | Pod not ready | Check readiness probe, pod logs |
| `curl` returns `000` | DNS/Ingress misconfigured | Verify DNS propagation, Ingress rules |
| Pods keep restarting | Liveness probe failing | Increase `initialDelaySeconds`, check app startup |
| Deployment stuck at 0/2 | Image pull failed | Check image name, pull secret |
| HPA shows `<unknown>` targets | Metrics server missing | Install metrics-server on cluster |
| Certificate shows "Not Ready" | cert-manager challenge failing | Check Ingress, DNS, cert-manager logs |

### Debugging Pod Restarts

```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app=task-api | grep -A 10 "Last State:"
```

**Output:**
```
    Last State:     Terminated
      Reason:       Error
      Exit Code:    1
      Started:      Mon, 30 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000
      Finished:     Mon, 30 Dec 2025 10:00:05 +0000
```

Check logs for the crash reason:

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=task-api --previous
```

### Debugging Image Pull Failures

```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app=task-api | grep -A 5 "Events:"
```

**Output (Fail):**
```
Events:
  Warning  Failed     1m    kubelet  Failed to pull image "ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0": unauthorized
```

Fix by creating or updating image pull secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr-secret \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=YOUR_USERNAME \
  --docker-password=YOUR_PAT
```

## Running the Full Checklist

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion to verify your production deployment collaboratively.

### Prompt 1: Checklist Review

```
I'm running a production checklist on my Kubernetes deployment. Here's
the output from kubectl describe pod for my task-api:

[paste your kubectl describe pod output]

Review this against production best practices. What's configured correctly?
What's missing? For anything missing, show me the exact YAML to add.
```

**What you're learning**: Pattern recognition—AI helps you spot configuration gaps you might overlook and generates correct fixes faster than manual YAML writing.

### Prompt 2: Failure Diagnosis

```
My production checklist shows these failures:
- Health endpoint returns 503
- Pods showing 1/2 ready
- HPA shows <unknown> for current metrics

Here are my logs and events:
[paste kubectl logs and kubectl describe pod output]

Diagnose these failures in order of priority. What's the root cause of each?
What's the fastest path to fixing all three?
```

**What you're learning**: Systematic debugging—AI helps you prioritize issues and identify root causes when multiple things fail simultaneously.

### Prompt 3: Checklist Customization

```
The 10-point checklist I learned covers general production readiness.
My Task API has specific requirements:
- It connects to a PostgreSQL database
- It calls OpenAI API for inference
- It needs to handle 100 requests/second peak

What additional checks should I add to my production checklist for these
specific requirements? Create kubectl commands for each check.
```

**What you're learning**: Checklist adaptation—production checklists should be customized for your application's specific dependencies and requirements.

### Safety Note

Always run verification commands on your actual deployment, not just in theory. AI can generate perfect-looking commands, but only execution against real infrastructure confirms your deployment is truly production-ready.

---

### Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `multi-cloud-deployer` skill:
- Does it include a production readiness checklist?
- Can it generate verification commands for any deployment?
- Does it know the common failures and fixes for each check?

If gaps exist, update your skill with the 10-point checklist pattern and debugging procedures from this lesson. A deployment skill isn't complete without verification capability.
