# Image Scanning and Supply Chain Security

In December 2020, attackers compromised SolarWinds' build system and injected malicious code into a software update that was distributed to 18,000 organizations, including the U.S. Treasury and Department of Homeland Security. The attackers didn't hack into those agencies directly—they poisoned the software supply chain, trusting that victims would install the update themselves.

Your Task API container image pulls from base images, installs packages, and bundles dependencies. Each layer introduces potential vulnerabilities. Without scanning, you deploy unknown risks into production. Without provenance verification, you trust that images are what they claim to be.

In May 2024, the XZ Utils backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) demonstrated how attackers can compromise widely-used libraries through patient, multi-year social engineering. The malicious code was caught just days before making it into major Linux distributions. This lesson teaches you to build automated defenses against these supply chain attacks.

## Scan Your Task API Image

Run a basic vulnerability scan against your Task API image:

```bash
trivy image task-api:latest
```

**Output:**

```

## Severity Levels and Remediation Priority

Not all vulnerabilities require immediate action. Prioritize based on severity and context:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Action Required | Timeframe |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **CRITICAL** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Stop deployment, fix immediately | Same day |
| **HIGH** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Schedule fix, monitor for exploits | Within 7 days |
| **MEDIUM** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Plan fix in next release | Within 30 days |
| **LOW** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Fix when convenient | Within 90 days |

**Filter by severity:**

```bash
trivy image task-api:latest --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
```

**Output:**

```
task-api:latest (debian 12.5)
=============================
Total: 12 (HIGH: 11, CRITICAL: 1)

┌──────────────────────┬────────────────┬──────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────┐
│       Library        │ Vulnerability  │ Severity │  Installed Version  │ Fixed Version │
├──────────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────┤
│ libssl3              │ CVE-2024-0727  │ CRITICAL │ 3.0.11-1~deb12u1    │ 3.0.13-1~deb12u1 │
│ libcurl4             │ CVE-2024-2398  │ HIGH     │ 7.88.1-10+deb12u4   │ 7.88.1-10+deb12u5 │
...
```

**Decision framework for CRITICAL vulnerabilities:**

1. **Is there a fixed version?** If yes, update base image or package
2. **Is the vulnerable code reachable?** If the library is included but unused, risk is lower
3. **Is there a known exploit?** Check Exploit Database or GitHub advisories
4. **Can you mitigate without patching?** NetworkPolicies, WAF rules, input validation

---

## CI/CD Integration

Integrate Trivy into your GitHub Actions workflow to prevent vulnerable images from reaching production.

**Create `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`:**

```yaml
name: Container Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  trivy-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build image
        run: docker build -t task-api:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: 'task-api:${{ github.sha }}'
          format: 'table'
          exit-code: '1'
          severity: 'CRITICAL'

      - name: Run Trivy scanner (full report)
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        if: always()
        with:
          image-ref: 'task-api:${{ github.sha }}'
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM'

      - name: Upload Trivy scan results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

**What this workflow does:**

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Build image | Creates image tagged with commit SHA |
| Run Trivy (exit-code: 1) | **Fails the build** if CRITICAL vulnerabilities found |
| Run Trivy (full report) | Generates SARIF report for all severity levels |
| Upload SARIF | Displays results in GitHub Security tab |

**Output when CRITICAL vulnerability detected:**

```
Run aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
2024-05-15T10:30:00Z  INFO  Number of vulnerabilities: 142
2024-05-15T10:30:00Z  FATAL  1 CRITICAL vulnerability found
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

The build fails, preventing deployment of the vulnerable image.

## Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

An SBOM lists every component in your container image—base OS packages, language dependencies, and application libraries. Compliance frameworks (SOC2, FedRAMP) increasingly require SBOMs for software audit trails.

**Generate SBOM in SPDX format:**

```bash
trivy image task-api:latest --format spdx-json --output sbom.json
```

**Output:**

```
2024-05-15T10:35:00Z  INFO  Generating SBOM in SPDX format
2024-05-15T10:35:02Z  INFO  SBOM written to sbom.json
```

**Inspect the SBOM:**

```bash
cat sbom.json | jq '.packages | length'
```

**Output:**

```
247
```

Your Task API image contains 247 distinct packages. When a new CVE is announced, you can search your SBOM to determine if you're affected:

```bash
cat sbom.json | jq '.packages[] | select(.name | contains("openssl"))'
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-Package-openssl-3.0.11",
  "name": "openssl",
  "versionInfo": "3.0.11-1~deb12u1",
  "supplier": "Organization: Debian",
  "downloadLocation": "https://packages.debian.org/openssl"
}
```

**SBOM formats:**

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| SPDX (JSON/TV) | Linux Foundation standard, wide adoption |
| CycloneDX | OWASP project, good for application dependencies |
| Syft | Anchore format, focused on container images |

For compliance, generate both SPDX and CycloneDX:

```bash
trivy image task-api:latest --format cyclonedx --output sbom-cdx.json
```

---

## Image Signing with Cosign (Overview)

Trivy detects vulnerabilities, but doesn't verify that an image is authentic. Cosign, part of the Sigstore project, signs container images cryptographically so you can verify provenance before deployment.

**Why signing matters:**

1. **Tampering detection**: Unsigned images could be modified in transit
2. **Audit trail**: Know exactly which pipeline built and approved an image
3. **Policy enforcement**: Require signatures before deployment

**Sign an image (keyless with OIDC):**

```bash
cosign sign ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0
```

**Output:**

```
Generating ephemeral keys...
Retrieving signed certificate...
tlog entry created with index: 12345678
Pushing signature to: ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:sha256-abc123.sig
```

Cosign uses keyless signing by default, authenticating via OIDC (GitHub, Google, Microsoft). No private keys to manage.

**Verify before deployment:**

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0
```

**Output:**

```
Verification for ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0 --
The following checks were performed:
- The cosign claims were validated
- The transparency log was verified
- The signatures were verified
```

**Production recommendation**: Use Kubernetes admission controllers (Kyverno, Gatekeeper) to enforce signature verification at deploy time. Without enforcement, signing is just documentation.

---

## Digest Pinning

Container tags are mutable—`task-api:latest` can point to different images over time. Attackers who compromise a registry can push malicious images using the same tag.

**The problem with tags:**

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: tag can be changed after you verified the image
image: ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0
```

**The solution: digest pinning:**

```yaml
# SECURE: digest is immutable, tied to exact image content
image: ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0@sha256:a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4
```

**Get the digest for your image:**

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' task-api:latest
```

**Output:**

```
ghcr.io/myorg/task-api@sha256:a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4
```

**Best practice workflow:**

1. Build and scan image in CI
2. Sign image with Cosign
3. Push image with tag AND digest
4. Deploy using digest-pinned reference
5. Store digest in Git for audit trail

## Security Checklist for Task API

Before promoting your Task API image to production, verify:

| Check | Command | Expected Result |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| No CRITICAL vulnerabilities | `trivy image task-api:latest --severity CRITICAL --exit-code 1` | Exit code 0 |
| SBOM generated | `trivy image task-api:latest --format spdx-json -o sbom.json` | File exists |
| Image signed (optional) | `cosign verify ghcr.io/myorg/task-api:v1.0.0` | Verification succeeded |
| Digest captured | `docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'` | SHA256 hash returned |

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `cloud-security` skill against what you learned:

```
Using my cloud-security skill, help me secure the CI/CD pipeline for
a new microservice that:
- Builds Docker images from a Python FastAPI application
- Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
- Deploys to Kubernetes via ArgoCD
- Must comply with SOC2 requirements

What scanning, signing, and SBOM generation should I implement?
```

**Evaluation questions:**

1. Does your skill recommend Trivy scanning with `--exit-code 1` for CRITICAL severity?
2. Does your skill suggest generating SBOMs for compliance audit trails?
3. Does your skill mention Cosign signing for image provenance?
4. Does your skill recommend digest pinning over tag-only references?
5. Does your skill integrate security checks as pipeline gates (not just reports)?

If any answers are "no," update your skill with the patterns from this lesson.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of image scanning and supply chain security.

**Prompt 1:**

```
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that scans a container image with Trivy,
fails on HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities, and uploads results to GitHub
Security tab. Use the official trivy-action.
```

**What you're learning:** Whether you understand CI/CD integration with Trivy. Key elements: `exit-code: '1'`, `severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'`, SARIF format upload. The workflow should stop deployment on security issues, not just report them.

**Prompt 2:**

```
My Trivy scan shows 200+ vulnerabilities in my Python application image,
but most are LOW severity from the Debian base image. How do I reduce
noise to focus on what matters? What base image alternatives might help?
```

**What you're learning:** Practical vulnerability management. Strategies include: Alpine/Distroless base images (fewer packages = fewer CVEs), multi-stage builds (dev dependencies excluded from final image), filtering by severity and fixability, ignoring vulnerabilities in packages your code doesn't use.

**Prompt 3:**

```
Explain to a non-technical stakeholder why we need both image scanning
AND image signing. Use an analogy they would understand. How do these
relate to compliance requirements like SOC2?
```

**What you're learning:** How to communicate security concepts to business stakeholders. Scanning is like checking a package for damage before accepting delivery. Signing is like a tamper-evident seal proving the package wasn't opened in transit. SOC2 requires evidence of both vulnerability management (scanning) and change management (signing provides audit trail).

:::warning Security Reminder
Trivy and other scanners only detect known vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs. Zero-day vulnerabilities won't appear in scan results. Defense in depth—NetworkPolicies, Pod Security Standards, RBAC—provides protection even when vulnerabilities exist in your code or dependencies. Scanning is essential but not sufficient.
