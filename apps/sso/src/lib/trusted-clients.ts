/**
 * Trusted OAuth Clients Configuration
 *
 * First-party applications that skip the OAuth consent screen.
 * These clients MUST also be seeded into the database for token storage.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * 1. Defined here (auth.ts imports for skipConsent behavior)
 * 2. Seeded into database (for token storage FK constraint)
 * 3. Protected in admin UI (cannot edit/delete via UI)
 *
 * Security:
 * - Localhost URLs are automatically filtered out in production
 * - Only HTTPS URLs allowed in production (except localhost in dev)
 */

/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ORGANIZATION CONFIGURATION
 * ==============================================================================
 * Default organization for the hybrid multi-tenant model.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Panaversity is the default organization for general users
 * - All new users auto-join this organization on signup
 * - Additional organizations can be created for institutions/schools
 * - This ID is hardcoded for performance (no DB lookup on every signup)
 *
 * Setup:
 * - Run `pnpm run seed:setup` to create this organization in database
 * - The seed script uses this same ID to ensure consistency
