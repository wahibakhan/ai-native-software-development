## Changes Made

### 1. Opening Hook (Rewrote for Acceleration Framing)

**Before:**

```
By Feature 3, the SDD-RI cycle is muscle memory. You've built Lead Profiler (F1)
and ICP Scorer (F2). Now build Outreach Generator...
```

**After:**

```
You've built Lead Profiler (F1, baseline time) and ICP Scorer (F2, likely 30-50% faster).
By Feature 3, the specification-driven cycle is automatic...

**Key question this lesson answers: How much faster is F3 than F2?** If intelligence
accumulation is real, F3 should feel significantly faster because template selection
and personalization logic are simpler than scoring logic.
```

**Why**: Sets acceleration expectation upfront. Students track time to measure SDD-RI effectiveness.

---

### 2. Template System Design (Enhanced Significantly)

**Before:**

- Simple JSON structure with three templates
- No explanation of WHY structure matters
- No guidance on how to verify

**After** (Part 1):

- **Rich template structure** with metadata:
  - `tone` and `approach` fields guide selection logic
  - `urgency` levels (high/medium/low)
  - `subject_patterns` provide multiple variants
  - `field_mapping` shows WHERE each field comes from
- **Explicit steps**: Create → Open → Verify → Understand why
- **90% hands-on**: Student creates JSON file, saves, opens in editor

---

### 3. Template Selection Logic Explicitness (New Section)

**NEW - Part 2: Understand Template Selection Logic**

Added decision tree before ANY code:

```markdown
## Selection Algorithm
```

IF icp_score.total_score >= 80 AND pain_point_confidence > 0.7
THEN use "hot" template
ELSE IF icp_score.total_score >= 50
THEN use "warm" template
ELSE
THEN use "cold" template

```

## Fallback Rules

If a required personalization field is missing from lead_profile:
- Use generic industry reference
- Flag confidence score (reduce by 10-15 points)
- Never hallucinate data
```

**Why**: Students see EXACT logic they'll implement before writing code (spec-first thinking).

---

### 4. Specification (New Section - Part 3)

**NEW - Complete Feature 3 Specification**

```markdown
# Feature 3: Outreach Generator — Specification

## Intent

Given a Lead Profile (F1 output) and ICP Score (F2 output), generate a personalized
outreach message by:

1. Selecting the appropriate template (hot/warm/cold) based on ICP score
2. Extracting personalization fields from lead profile
   [... 6 detailed steps ...]

## Inputs

[Complete JSON schema for Lead Profile and ICP Score]

## Output

[Complete JSON schema with all output fields]

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Correct template selected based on ICP score range
- ✅ All {field} placeholders filled with actual lead profile data
- ✅ No placeholder markers remain in final message
- ✅ Message reads naturally without obvious template markers
- ✅ Subject line tone matches template tone
- ✅ Confidence score reflects quality of personalization
- ✅ Fallback handling: graceful degradation if fields missing

## Constraints

- Input format: Exactly as defined above (outputs from F1 and F2)
- Must use only three templates (hot/warm/cold)
- Personalization: Must use ONLY data from lead_profile (no hallucinations)
- Confidence: Must explain reasoning for score (not arbitrary)

## Non-Goals

- Email validation
- Sending outreach
- A/B testing variants
```

**Why**: Students understand intent and success criteria BEFORE implementing (evals-first).

---

### 5. Algorithm Pseudo-Code (New Section - Part 4 intro)

**NEW - High-Level Algorithm**

```markdown
## Main Function: `generate_outreach(lead_profile, icp_score)`

1. **Load Templates**

   - Load outreach_templates.json
   - Validate all three templates present

2. **Select Template**

   - Read icp_score.total_score
   - Use decision tree to determine hot/warm/cold
   - Return selected template object

3. **Extract Personalization Fields**

   - For each field in personalization_fields:
     - Search lead_profile for field value
     - If found: add to extracted_fields
     - If missing: flag for fallback handling

4. **Fill Template** ... [7 total steps]

## Complexity Indicators

- Simpler than F2 (fewer decision points, less computation)
- Template selection is rule-based (not ML)
- Field mapping is deterministic (not probabilistic)
- **This is why F3 should be notably faster than F2**
```

**Why**: Students see structural thinking before code (schema of solution).

---

### 6. Production Code Implementation (625 Lines)

**NEW - Complete `outreach_generator.py`**

Key components:

**Type-Safe Interfaces** (TypedDict):

```python
class PersonalizationField(TypedDict):
    field: str
    value: str
    source: str

class OutreachOutput(TypedDict):
    company_name: str
    outreach_message: str
    template_used: str
    personalization_applied: list[PersonalizationField]
    suggested_subject_line: str
    subject_line_variants: list[str]
    confidence: int
    confidence_reasoning: str
```

**Modular Functions** (6 core functions + main orchestration):

1. `select_template()` - Template selection logic
2. `extract_personalization_fields()` - Field extraction with fallback handling
3. `fill_template()` - Replace {field} markers
4. `generate_subject_lines()` - Subject line variants
5. `calculate_confidence()` - Confidence scoring with reasoning
6. `generate_outreach()` - Main orchestration
7. CLI handling with stdin/file inputs

**Production Patterns**:

- Type hints throughout
- Docstrings explain purpose and returns
- Error handling for missing fields
- No hallucinated data (fallback to industry defaults)
- Confidence reasoning (transparent scoring)

**Example confidence calculation**:

```python
def calculate_confidence(icp_score, missing_fields, filled_count):
    base_score = 100
    reasoning_parts = [f"Base score: {base_score}"]

    # Penalty for missing fields (each -15)
    missing_penalty = len(missing_fields) * 15

    # Adjustment based on ICP score range
    if icp_total < 50:
        icp_adjustment = -10

    # Pain point confidence factor
    if pain_confidence < 50:
        pain_penalty = -10

    final_score = max(0, min(100, base_score - missing_penalty + icp_adjustment - pain_penalty))
    return final_score, reasoning
```

---

### 7. Pipeline Integration Tests (New Section - Part 5)

**Before**: Vague instruction ("Test full pipeline")

**After**: Three concrete test scenarios:

**Test 1: Sequential Execution (Files)**

```bash
time python outreach_generator.py profile.json score.json
```

**Test 2: Full Three-Feature Pipeline**

```bash
time bash -c 'URL="https://stripe.com" && \
python lead_profiler.py $URL > f1.json && \
python icp_scorer.py f1.json > f2.json && \
python outreach_generator.py f1.json f2.json > f3.json && \
cat f3.json'
```

**Test 3: Timing Comparison**

```bash
echo "=== Feature 1: Lead Profiler ===" && time python ...
echo "=== Feature 2: ICP Scorer ===" && time python ...
echo "=== Feature 3: Outreach Generator ===" && time python ...
```

**Expected Pattern** (showing intelligence accumulation):

```
F1 time: ~30-45 seconds (baseline)
F2 time: ~20-30 seconds (60-70% of F1)
F3 time: ~10-15 seconds (30-40% of F1)
```

**Recording template**:

```
Feature 1: _____ seconds
Feature 2: _____ seconds  (% of F1)
Feature 3: _____ seconds  (% of F1)
Total:     _____ seconds

Pattern observed:
[ ] F3 is faster than F2 ✓ (confirms intelligence reuse)
```

### 8. Quality Validation Checklist (New Section - Part 6)

**NEW - Manual Template Quality Gates**

Before using AI, students validate their outputs:

```
For each generated message:

[ ] Template selection correct
    - Hot selected when ICP score >= 80 AND pain_point_confidence > 70
    - Warm selected when ICP score >= 50
    - Cold selected otherwise

[ ] Personalization specificity
    - Company name and industry visible
    - Pain point reference specific to company (not generic)
    - Value statement relevant to identified pain point

[ ] Message readability
    - No {unfilled} template markers remain
    - Sentence flow is natural (not robotic)
    - Tone matches template type (direct/educational/nurture)

[ ] Subject line quality
    - First variant mentions specific company or pain point
    - Variants offer different hooks (curiosity, value, pain, proof, question)
    - All variants match template tone

[ ] Confidence score accuracy
    - Score >= 85 when all fields present: makes sense
    - Score 70-85 when 1-2 fields missing: reasonable penalty
    - Score <= 70 when 3+ fields missing: justified
    - Reasoning explains the score (not arbitrary)
```

**Concrete Example Validation** (Stripe):

```
Input:
- F1 profile: Stripe (fintech, complex payment regulations)
- F2 score: 95 (hot: high industry match, strong pain point signal)

Output (F3):
{
  "template_used": "hot",
  "outreach_message": "Hi Sarah, I noticed Stripe is navigating complex payment
    regulations while scaling globally. We help fintech companies like yours
    automate compliance workflows. Worth a 15-minute call this week?",
  "confidence": 95
}

Validation:
✅ "Hot" correct (95 score, high pain_point_confidence)
✅ Stripe + fintech visible → company-specific, not generic
✅ "complex payment regulations" is exact pain point from F1
✅ "automate compliance workflows" matches industry
✅ No template markers ({field} symbols) remain
✅ Message reads naturally (not robotic)
✅ 95 confidence justified (all fields present, high ICP match)
```

---

### 9. Specific AI Prompts (New Section - Part 7)

**BEFORE**: Generic "Try With AI" prompts

```
Prompt 1: "Review the personalization..."
Prompt 2: "Generate 5 subject line variations..."
```

**AFTER**: Two highly specific, contextualized prompts

**Prompt 1: Template Evaluation (Full context)**

```
I've built an outreach message generator for a sales pipeline.
Here's a message my system generated:

MESSAGE:
---
Hi Sarah, I noticed Stripe is navigating complex payment regulations
while scaling globally. We help fintech companies like yours automate
compliance workflows. Worth a 15-minute call this week?
---

Template Used: "hot" (direct, value-focused)
Confidence Score: 95

Questions for you:

1. **Specificity Test**: Is this message specific enough that it feels
   personalized to Stripe, or could it be sent to any fintech company?

2. **Personalization Depth**: Which parts feel the most personalized
   (company-specific) vs generic? Which parts would benefit from more
   detail?

3. **Template Fit**: For a company scoring 95/100 ICP match with strong
   pain point signals, does "hot" (direct value prop) seem like the
   right tone? Would "warm" (educational insight) work better?

4. **Pain Point Accuracy**: "Complex payment regulations while scaling
   globally" — is this specific enough, or too broad? What level of
   specificity would make this feel researched?

Respond with specific feedback, not general advice.
```

**Prompt 2: Subject Line Optimization (With psychological hooks)**

```
I'm testing subject line effectiveness for outreach messages.
Here's my message and the subject lines my system generated:

OUTREACH MESSAGE:
Hi Sarah, I noticed Stripe is navigating complex payment regulations
while scaling globally. We help fintech companies like yours automate
compliance workflows. Worth a 15-minute call this week?

SUBJECT LINES (from my system):
1. "Stripe + automate compliance workflows"
2. "Quick question about navigating complex payment regulations
   while scaling globally"
3. "fintech compliance: one approach"

Task: Generate 5 NEW subject line variations that each use a different
psychological hook:
1. Curiosity hook (intriguing but not clickbait)
2. Value statement (what they gain)
3. Pain point acknowledgment (shows you understand their problem)
4. Social proof (hint that peers are solving this)
5. Direct question (invitation to engagement)

For each, explain which hook you used and why it would work for a
fintech CFO deciding whether to take a 15-minute call.
```

### 10. Time Tracking & Analysis Summary (New - Part 8)

**NEW - Explicit Recording Template**

```
Feature 1 (F1): _____ minutes (your baseline)
Feature 2 (F2): _____ minutes (% of F1: ____)
Feature 3 (F3): _____ minutes (% of F1: ____)

Total capstone time so far: _____ minutes

Analysis:
- F3 is faster than F2 by: _____ seconds  ✓ Intelligence accumulation working
- Complexity tier: F3 << F2 << F1 (confirms spec-first design progression)
- Ready for F4: Campaign Dashboard (should be < 50% of F1)
```

---

### 11. Learning Summary (New - Part 9)

**NEW - Explicit Pattern Discovery**

Teaches the core insight: **specification quality accelerates implementation**

```markdown
## Summary: What You Learned

By building Feature 3, you proved that **specification quality accelerates
implementation**.

**Specification → Implementation Time Correlation:**

| Feature | Spec Complexity             | Implementation Decisions | Time     | % of F1 |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| F1      | High (new product)          | 15+ decisions            | Baseline | 100%    |
| F2      | Medium (reuses F1 outputs)  | 8-10 decisions           | Lower    | 50-70%  |
| F3      | Low (simple template logic) | 3-5 decisions            | Lowest   | 30-40%  |

**Why F3 is faster:**

- You don't design the scoring algorithm (done in F2)
- You don't scrape and extract data (done in F1)
- You implement template selection (rule-based, not probabilistic)
- You map fields deterministically (not learned from data)
- Confidence scoring has explicit formulas (no complexity)

This is specification-driven reusable intelligence in action: **each feature
builds on previous specifications, reducing cognitive load for the next feature.**
```

## CEFR B1 Compliance Check

**Proficiency Level**: B1 (Intermediate)
**Cognitive Load Limit**: 7-10 new concepts per lesson
**Complexity Tier**: Apply/Analyze (Bloom's)
**Scaffolding**: Moderate (high-level guidance, student finds approach)

**Concepts Taught** (count: 9):

1. Template system architecture (tone, approach, patterns)
2. Selection algorithm (decision tree logic)
3. Field extraction and mapping
4. Template substitution (placeholder replacement)
5. Fallback handling (no hallucinations)
6. Confidence scoring (formula-based)
7. Subject line generation (variants)
8. F1→F2→F3 pipeline composition
9. Time tracking for acceleration measurement

**Scaffolding Level**: Moderate

- High-level guidance: "Build outreach generator" → decomposed into 9 concrete parts
- Student finds approach: "Review code structure, understand why each function exists"
- Heavy scaffolding in early parts (Part 1-3), less in later (Part 4-8)

**Bloom's Level**: Apply/Analyze

- Apply: Implement template selection logic, field extraction
- Analyze: Compare F1/F2/F3 timing, evaluate personalization quality, assess confidence scoring

**Compliance**: PASS

---

## Three Roles Framework (Layer 4)

**Note**: This is a Layer 4 (Spec-Driven Integration) lesson in a capstone. Three Roles framework (Teacher/Student/Co-Worker) is primarily Layer 2.

**How applied here** (context-appropriate):

- **Co-Worker role**: AI helps evaluate template quality (Part 7: specific prompts)
- **Student role**: Student validates outputs before trusting AI feedback (Part 6: checklist)
- **Teacher role**: Implicit in specification → implementation workflow

**Framework visibility**: Invisible to student (no role labels, natural progression of work)

## How to Use This Enhanced Lesson

### For Instructors

1. **Verify code works**: Run `outreach_generator.py` with F1/F2 outputs to confirm timing
2. **Set expectations**: Emphasize that F3 SHOULD be faster than F2 (tests hypothesis)
3. **Provide context**: Remind students that simpler specs → faster implementation
4. **Review outputs**: Use Part 6 checklist to grade student-generated messages

### For Students

1. **Follow parts in order** (1-9): Each part builds on previous
2. **Create files you'll reference** (templates.json, decision tree, spec)
3. **Time yourself** and record for Parts 1-8 analysis
4. **Validate before AI**: Use Part 6 checklist before "Try With AI" section
5. **Compare to F2**: Is F3 truly faster? Why or why not?

### For AI-Native Development Instructors

- **Shows SDD-RI in action**: Each feature (F1→F2→F3) reduces spec complexity
- **Demonstrates reusability**: F3 uses F1/F2 outputs without redesigning them
- **Proves time acceleration**: Metrics show intelligence accumulation works
- **Teaches confidence**: Explicit formula → transparency in AI outputs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Lesson 05 (Feature 4)**: Dashboard should take <50% of F1 time (proof of acceleration)
2. **Lesson 06**: Create reusable skills from F1-F4 patterns
3. **Lesson 07**: Retrospective + insights on SDD-RI effectiveness
