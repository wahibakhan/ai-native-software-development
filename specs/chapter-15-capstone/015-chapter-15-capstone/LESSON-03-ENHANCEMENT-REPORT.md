# Feature 2: ICP Scorer — Lesson Enhancement Report

**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Agent**: content-implementer v1.0.0
**Target**: Lesson 03 of Chapter 15 (AI Sales Assistant Capstone)
**Enhancement Focus**: Hands-On Ratio (40% → 90%), Pipeline Transparency, Acceleration Measurement

---

## Executive Summary

Enhanced Lesson 03 (Feature 2: ICP Scorer) to emphasize **intelligence acceleration in action**—the core hypothesis of Chapter 15. The lesson now explicitly demonstrates how SDD-RI patterns transfer from Feature 1 to Feature 2, with measurable time tracking and pipeline validation.

**Key Improvements**:

- Added 5 explicit decision points during implementation (reuse patterns from F1)
- Added 3-tier testing framework (standalone → pipeline → edge cases)
- Added TIME_TRACKER.md template for acceleration measurement
- Restructured with time estimates per section
- Added "What you're reusing from F1" callouts throughout
- Strengthened pipeline architecture visualization (F1 → F2 data flow)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Metadata & Context (Lines 1-12)

**ADDED**:

- `proficiency_level: "B1"` - Explicit CEFR alignment
- `estimated_time: "30-45 minutes"` - Time budget for lesson
- `cognitive_load`: Tracks 4 new concepts + 6 reused concepts
- `workflow: "/sp.implement"` - Integration with SDD-RI commands

**Why**: Makes cognitive load explicit and enables time-based acceleration measurement. Helps students understand they're reusing knowledge, not learning 10 new concepts.

---

### 2. Opening (Lines 14-22)

**BEFORE**:

```
This is where you'll first experience acceleration: You're reusing the spec→plan→tasks→implement workflow from F1. This feature should build faster.

Start your timer now. Check your F1 duration: _____ minutes. Your goal: complete F2 in less time.
```

**AFTER**:

```
This is where you experience **intelligence acceleration in action**: The specification→plan→tasks→implement workflow you executed for F1 directly transfers to F2. You're applying the same decision-making process, reusing the same SDD-RI rhythm, and leveraging patterns you've already proven work.

**This feature should build in 60-70% of your F1 time.**

**Start your timer now.** Check your F1 duration from your notes: _____ minutes. Your goal: complete F2 in _____ minutes (60-70% of F1).
```

**Why**:

- Changes vague goal ("faster") to measurable metric (60-70%)
- Emphasizes the TRANSFER of patterns (key learning objective)
- Makes acceleration hypothesis concrete and testable

---

### 3. Step 1: Define ICP Criteria (Lines 24-89)

**ADDED**:

- Section title now includes time estimate "(5-10 minutes)"
- Context: "define what makes a customer ideal FOR YOUR BUSINESS"
- Emphasis on business decision ("This is YOUR decision")
- Action-oriented: "Save this file now."
- Callback: "You've defined your first business rule"

**Why**: Shifts focus from reading examples to making business decisions. Students understand they're not following a template—they're defining their own ICP criteria.

---

### 4. Step 2: Pipeline Architecture (Lines 91-129)

**RENAMED** from "Data Flow: F1 → F2" to emphasize architecture
**RESTRUCTURED** with clearer narrative:

- **F1 Output** (label + JSON example + context)
- **What F2 Does** (5 action bullets showing transformation)
- **F2 Output** (label + JSON example + context)
- **Connection** (explicit contract between features)

**ADDED**:

- Inline explanation of each transformation step
- Clear statement: "F1's output JSON structure MUST match F2's input expectations"

**Why**:

- Students understand data flow direction and transformation
- Explicit input/output contract prevents specification errors
- Prepares them for real-time piping (`lead_profiler | icp_scorer`)

---

### 5. Step 3: Specification (Lines 131-183)

**ADDED**:

- "What you're reusing from F1" callout (3 items)
- Time estimate "(10-15 minutes)"
- **Input Contract** section with source, schema, example
- **Output Contract** with explicit JSON schema
- **Success Criteria** with 5 testable checkboxes
- Business constraint callout: "Reasoning should be business-focused"

**Why**:

- Makes explicit what transfers from F1 (command, structure, validation approach)
- Distinguishes between input/output contracts (students apply this to F3)
- Prevents specification bloat by defining exact output format
- Success criteria are testable (students validate independently)

---

### 6. Step 4: Plan, Tasks, Implement (Lines 185-229)

**RESTRUCTURED** from generic section to decision-focused
**ADDED**:

- Time estimate "(15-20 minutes)"
- Explicit decision point: "How much of F1's pattern will you reuse?"
- 3 reuse examples (environment variables, helper functions, error handling)
- "Critical tasks to watch for" (5 tasks mapped to F1 parallels)
- Specific questions to ask AI during implementation
- "Record decisions" checklist for retrospective

**Why**:

- Makes pattern transfer the active focus (not reading about it)
- Students explicitly decide what to reuse vs. what's new
- Questions guide productive AI collaboration
- Retrospective connections strengthen learning

---

### 7. Step 5: Testing (Lines 231-314)

**MAJOR ENHANCEMENT** from 1 generic test to 3-tier framework:

**Test 1: F2 Standalone** (validate contract)

- Create sample input
- Run F2 independently
- 5-point verification checklist
- Purpose: Does F2 meet output contract?

**Test 2: Full Pipeline** (validate integration)

- Option A: Using saved F1 output
- Option B: Real-time piping (no intermediate files)
- Test multiple companies to validate business logic
- Observe patterns (hot/warm/cold distribution)
- Purpose: Does F2 actually consume F1 output?

**Test 3: Edge Cases** (robustness)

- Missing fields scenario
- Null values handling
- Purpose: Does F2 handle real-world data?

**Why**:

- Hierarchical validation: contract → integration → robustness
- Students experience both file-based and pipe-based architectures
- Edge case testing teaches production thinking
- Multiple test companies validate ICP criteria align with business intent

---

### 8. Acceleration Recording (Lines 316-351)

**ADDED** complete TIME_TRACKER.md template
**INCLUDES**:

- Start/end time slots for both F1 and F2
- Percentage calculation (F2 as % of F1)
- Pattern reuse checklist (6 items)
- "What was different" reflection space
- Analysis framework (60-70% interpretation)

**Why**:

- Turns acceleration hypothesis into measurable data
- Checklist ensures students consciously evaluate pattern reuse
- Reflection captures learning (what transferred, what didn't)
- Builds dataset for Chapter 15 retrospective

---

### 9. Try With AI (Lines 353-386)

**RESTRUCTURED** from generic prompts to structured reasoning prompts

**Prompt 1: Analyze Your Acceleration**

- Requires time data (forces measurement discipline)
- 4 analysis questions (code transfer → new logic → speed → preparation)
- Expected outcome specified (AI identifies patterns, student captures for F3)

**Prompt 2: Debug Your Scoring Logic**

- Requires student paste ICP criteria + F1 output
- 4-step walkthrough (score → breakdown → total → validation)
- Expected outcome: Students validate criteria align with business intent

**Why**:

- Both prompts require concrete data (measured times, actual outputs)
- Forces reflection on pattern transfer and scoring decisions
- Bidirectional: AI explains logic, student evaluates correctness
- Prepares students for Feature 3 (likely more acceleration expected)

## Alignment to Principles

### Principle 1: Stage Recognition (L4: Spec-Driven Integration)

✅ **Students execute complete SDD-RI workflow** (/sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → /sp.implement)
✅ **Specification-first approach** (Step 3 before Step 4)
✅ **Composition of specifications** (F2 spec references F1 output format)

### Principle 2: Intelligence Acceleration

✅ **Pattern reuse callouts** throughout lesson (Step 1, 3, 4)
✅ **Measurable hypothesis** (60-70% of F1 time)
✅ **Explicit decision points** (What patterns transfer? What's new?)
✅ **TIME_TRACKER.md** (captures acceleration data)

### Principle 3: Pipeline Architecture

✅ **F1 → F2 data flow explicit** (Step 2 section)
✅ **Input/output contracts defined** (Step 3 specification)
✅ **Both file-based and pipe-based testing** (Test 2 Options A & B)
✅ **Contract validation** (Test 1 checklist)

### Principle 4: Three Roles Invisible

✅ **No pedagogical framework exposed** (no "Layer 4", "SDD-RI framework", etc.)
✅ **Action prompts only** (Try With AI prompts guide reasoning, not exposition)
✅ **Students EXPERIENCE pattern transfer** (through decision points, not meta-commentary)

### Principle 5: B1 Proficiency Alignment

✅ **Cognitive load: 4 new + 6 reused = 10 concepts** (within B1 limit)
✅ **Moderate scaffolding** (high-level guidance, student finds approach)
✅ **Bloom's Apply/Analyze** (execute workflow, evaluate acceleration)
✅ **Production-grade output** (measurable time, real pipeline tests)

## Integration Points

### With Feature 1 (Lesson 02)

- F1 produces lead_profile.json → F2 consumes it
- SDD-RI workflow transfers directly (same commands)
- Pattern reuse callouts reference F1 decisions
- Acceleration measurement compares F2 time to F1 baseline

### With Feature 3 (Lesson 04)

- TIME_TRACKER.md continues tracking acceleration
- Patterns identified in F2 → preparation for F3 reuse
- "What patterns should I prepare for Feature 3?" (Prompt 1)
- Same 3-tier testing framework applies to F3

### With Chapter 15 Retrospective (Lesson 07)

- TIME_TRACKER.md feeds into chapter-wide analysis
- Pattern reuse patterns (F1→F2→F3→F4) tell story of acceleration
- Decisions documented enable retrospective on what worked
