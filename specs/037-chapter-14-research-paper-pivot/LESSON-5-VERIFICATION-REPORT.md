# Lesson 5 Verification Report: Clarify Phase

**Date**: 2025-11-26
**Lesson**: 05-clarify-phase.md
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Rewrite Reason**: Pivot from video generation to research paper context

---

## Requirement Compliance

### Critical Focus: `/sp.clarify` Command (PRIMARY)

✅ **TEACHING THE COMMAND** (Not the practice vehicle)

- Section "What Does /sp.clarify Do?" explains command functionality
- Section "The Clarify Workflow" shows 3-step usage pattern
- "Try With AI" section practices `/sp.clarify` directly
- Research paper is vehicle ONLY, not focus

✅ **COMMAND SYNTAX CLEAR**

- Shows exact `/sp.clarify` invocation in code block
- Explains what feedback to expect (ambiguous terms, missing assumptions, incomplete requirements, scope conflicts)
- Demonstrates iteration pattern (run → evaluate → update → re-run)

### Removed Elements

✅ **Video-Specific Content Removed**

- ❌ No "Gemini constraints"
- ❌ No "session timeout handling"
- ❌ No "MP4 vs WebM format compatibility"
- ❌ No "Playwright MCP integration"
- ❌ No "video quality parameters"

✅ **Tool-Specific Content Removed**

- ❌ No MCP references
- ❌ No Playwright references
- ❌ No external API references

### Cognitive Load (B1 Tier)

✅ **New Concepts Count: 4** (Within B1 limit of 7-10)

1. Clarify workflow (command execution)
2. Gap detection (identifying ambiguities)
3. Ambiguity resolution (updating specs)
4. Iterative refinement (clarify cycles)

✅ **Proficiency Alignment**

- Duration: 30 minutes (appropriate for B1)
- Bloom's level: Apply → Analyze → Evaluate (matches B1)
- Scaffolding: Moderate (guided independence)

### Learning Objectives

✅ **Three Learning Objectives Aligned to Spec**

1. Use /sp.clarify command to identify gaps in specifications (Apply)
2. Recognize ambiguities and missing assumptions (Analyze)
3. Iteratively refine specifications based on AI feedback (Evaluate)

### Practice Vehicle: Research Paper

✅ **Paper Used As PRACTICE EXAMPLE ONLY**

- Introduction: "In Lesson 04, you wrote a specification for your research paper"
- Examples show paper-specific ambiguities (citation style, word count, audience, sources)
- "Clarifying Your Paper Specification" section provides concrete practice
- Never taught how to WRITE papers, only how to CLARIFY specifications

✅ **Paper-Specific Examples Are Relatable**

- Citation style ambiguity (APA? MLA? Chicago?)
- Word count clarity (3,000-4,000 words?)
- Audience definition (who will read this?)
- Source requirements (how many? what type?)
- Structure clarity (chronological? thematic?)

### Content Structure

✅ **Section Organization (Clear Progression)**

1. **Opening Hook**: Establishes what clarify does and why
2. **What Does /sp.clarify Do?**: Explains 4 gap types
3. **Why Clarify Matters**: Shows before/after spec clarity
4. **The Clarify Workflow**: 3-step process with code examples
5. **Clarifying Your Paper Specification**: Hands-on practice
6. **Prevention**: Why clarification prevents problems
7. **Common Mistakes**: Error patterns and fixes
8. **Try With AI**: Practice with AI companion

✅ **Ends With "Try With AI"** (Correct structure)

- 4 copyable prompts for AI exploration
- Each prompt focuses on `/sp.clarify` practice
- No summary, takeaways, or meta-commentary after

### Frontmatter Compliance

✅ **Required Fields Present**

```yaml
title: "Clarify Phase" ✅
chapter: 14 ✅
lesson: 5 ✅
duration_minutes: 30 ✅
proficiency_level: "B1" ✅
cognitive_load:
  new_concepts: 4 ✅
```

✅ **Learning Objectives Well-Formed**

- Each has proficiency_level
- Each has bloom_level
- Each has assessment_method

✅ **Metadata Complete**

- generated_by: content-implementer v1.0.0
- source_spec: specs/037-chapter-14-research-paper-pivot/spec.md
- workflow: /sp.implement

---

## Constitutional Alignment

✅ **Section IIa: 4-Layer Progression**

- Lesson 5 = Layer 2 (AI Collaboration)
- Teaches use of AI command in partnership
- No AI as passive tool (students collaborate with clarification process)

✅ **Principle 2: Progressive Complexity**

- 4 concepts < 10 concept B1 limit
- Scaffolding matches proficiency (moderate)

✅ **Principle 3: Factual Accuracy**

- `/sp.clarify` command described accurately
- Gap types match actual command feedback patterns
- Workflow is correct (run → interpret → update → verify)

✅ **Principle 6: Anti-Convergence**

- Chapter 13 (SDD-RI theory) → Chapter 14 (hands-on workflow)
- Distinct from other lessons (each teaches one command)
- Not defaulting to tutorial patterns

✅ **Principle 7: Minimal Content**

- Every section maps to learning objectives
- No tangential research paper writing content
- All content serves `/sp.clarify` mastery

## Spec Requirement Compliance

### Functional Requirements

✅ **FR-014**: Lesson 05 MUST teach `/sp.clarify`

- Primary focus of entire lesson
- "Try With AI" section practices the command

✅ **FR-007**: Every "Try With AI" section MUST practice a Spec-Kit Plus command

- All 4 prompts in Try With AI section practice `/sp.clarify`
- No tangential activities

✅ **FR-006**: Lessons MUST focus on Spec-Kit Plus workflow, using paper as simple example

- Research paper is vehicle for practicing clarification
- No paper writing techniques taught
- Entire lesson is about the `/sp.clarify` command

✅ **FR-004**: Lessons MUST NOT teach research paper writing techniques

- No writing style guidance
- No structure recommendations for papers generally
- Only clarification of specifications

✅ **FR-008-011**: Technical Constraints

- ✅ No Python required
- ✅ No MCP servers required
- ✅ No external APIs required
- ✅ Uses only: AI companion, markdown, terminal, git
