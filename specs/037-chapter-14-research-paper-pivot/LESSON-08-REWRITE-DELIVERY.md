# Lesson 08 Rewrite Delivery Summary

**Lesson**: Implement Phase
**Chapter**: 14 — Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On
**File**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/storage/apps/learn-app/docs/04-SDD-RI-Fundamentals/14-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/08-implement-phase.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Version**: 2.0.0 (Complete Rewrite)
**Date**: 2025-11-26

## What Changed

### FOCUS REORIENTED

**Before**: Lesson focused on executing video generation with Playwright MCP and Gemini browser automation
**After**: Lesson focuses on teaching `/sp.implement` command itself, using research paper as the practice vehicle

### REMOVED (All Forbidden Content)

- Video generation execution details
- Playwright automation specifics
- Gemini.google.com references
- MCP browser automation
- ffprobe validation for video files
- Session persistence for browser automation
- Playwright selector management

### ADDED (New /sp.implement Teaching)

- Clear explanation of what implementation means in SDD-RI context
- `/sp.implement` command syntax and basic usage
- Checkpoint pattern as core control mechanism
- Four foundational concepts:
  1. Implementation ≠ Autonomous Execution
  2. Spec Success Criteria Are Your Acceptance Standard
  3. Iteration Loops Accelerate Problem-Solving
  4. AI Collaboration During Execution
- Detailed example walkthrough (research paper project with 3 checkpoints)
- Checkpoint decision framework (Commit / Iterate / Revise Plan)
- Three implementation patterns (Serial, Parallel, Iterative Refinement)
- Validation against specification with concrete checklists
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Learning Objectives

All 4 objectives mapped to B1 proficiency (Bloom's Apply/Understand/Evaluate):

1. **Understand** implementation as executing tasks that fulfill specification
2. **Apply** /sp.implement command to execute tasks with AI assistance
3. **Apply** checkpoint pattern to maintain control during implementation
4. **Evaluate** task completion against specification success criteria

## Cognitive Load Assessment

**New Concepts**: 4 (within B1 limit of 7-10)

1. Implementation execution (orchestrated, not autonomous)
2. Checkpoint validation (spec-driven acceptance criteria)
3. Iterative refinement (failure → iteration → success)
4. AI collaboration during execution (role dynamic)

**Scaffolding Level**: Moderate (appropriate for B1)

- Clear examples with concrete research paper project
- Explicit framework for decision-making
- Anti-patterns explicitly named and contrasted with patterns
- Validation checklist provided for reference

---

## Practice Vehicle: Research Paper Project

**Why Research Paper?**

- Clear structure (intro, lit review, methodology, analysis, conclusion)
- Measurable success criteria (word counts, source requirements)
- Iterative nature mirrors implementation workflow
- No external API/tool dependencies
- Appropriate for B1 complexity

**How It's Used:**

- Section-by-section example of checkpoint reviews
- Specific task descriptions with acceptance criteria
- Concrete iteration scenario (450 words → 500-700 requirement)
- Final validation showing all phases passed

## Try With AI Section

**5 Exploration Prompts** teaching complementary angles:

1. **Explore the Command Structure** — Understand `/sp.implement` workflow
2. **Practice Checkpoint Review** — Learn validation process
3. **Handle Iteration** — Develop feedback language
4. **Reflect on Specification Alignment** — Make checkpoint decisions
5. **Design Your First Checkpoint** — Apply patterns to new project

| 4 Concepts Max               | ✓      | Exactly 4 concepts within B1 limit                             |
| Ends with "Try With AI"      | ✓      | Last section is "Try With AI" with 5 prompts                   |
| No Meta-Commentary           | ✓      | No "AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker" labels (roles invisible)  |
| No "What's Next" / "Summary" | ✓      | Only section after Try With AI is end-of-file marker           |
| Duration Realistic           | ✓      | 60 minutes covers command + 4 concepts + example + practice    |

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. Review for content accuracy with Chapter 13 continuity
2. Consider summary file generation (`.summary.md`) if desired
3. Validate lesson flows naturally from Lesson 7 (Tasks) to Lesson 9 (Intelligence Design)
4. Consider updating chapter README if references to lesson content changed

**Prepared by**: Claude Code / content-implementer v1.0.0
**Rewrite Rationale**: Refocus from technical implementation details (video generation) to pedagogical core (teaching `/sp.implement` command with research paper as illustrative example)
