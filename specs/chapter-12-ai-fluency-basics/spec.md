# Chapter 12: AI Fluency Basics - Prompt & Context Engineering

## Overview

**Part**: 3 (Markdown & Context Engineering)
**Position**: Chapter 12 (after Markdown chapter)
**Proficiency Level**: A2-B1
**Duration**: 6-8 hours total

This chapter merges the former "Prompt Engineering for AIDD" (old Chapter 11) and "Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development" (old Chapter 12) into a unified chapter based on **Anthropic's AI Fluency Framework** with the 4Ds: Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence.

## Rationale for Merge

1. **Industry Shift**: Andrej Karpathy notes that "prompt engineering" is now a subset of "context engineering"
2. **Framework Alignment**: Anthropic's 4D framework unifies prompting and context management
3. **Content Overlap**: Many lessons had redundant concepts (iteration, refinement, validation)
4. **Quality Issues**: Old Ch11 L2 contained unverifiable "Zia Kaukab 8-Element Framework"
5. **Template Obsolescence**: Old Ch11 L6-L8 (templates) are now obsolete with modern models

### Lesson 3: Description - Prompt Structure & Clarity (REWRITE)
**Duration**: 35 min | **Proficiency**: A2 | **Concepts**: 6

**Source**: REPLACE old Ch11 L2 (had unverifiable Zia Kaukab framework)

**Content Disposition**: REPLACE with verified content

**Learning Objectives**:
- Apply the 6 prompting techniques from Anthropic
- Structure prompts using Product-Process-Performance framework
- Use action verbs for clear intent
- Identify what makes descriptions effective

**Key Content**:
- **6 Prompting Techniques** (Anthropic):
  1. Give context
  2. Show examples
  3. Specify constraints
  4. Break into steps
  5. Ask AI to think first
  6. Define role/tone
- Description sub-components: Product, Process, Performance
- Intent → Constraints → Success Criteria (keep, but simplified)
- Action verb taxonomy (CREATE, DEBUG, REFACTOR, etc.)

**Removed**:
- ❌ "Zia Kaukab 8-Element Framework" (unverifiable)
- ❌ Overly complex prompt anatomy

**Why Rewrite**:
Previous lesson cited "Zia Kaukab's prompting research at Google" which could not be verified. Replace with documented Anthropic 6 techniques.

### Lesson 7: Discernment - Iterative Refinement (MERGE)
**Duration**: 45 min | **Proficiency**: B1 | **Concepts**: 7

**Source**: Merge old Ch11 L3 (Iterative Refinement) + old Ch12 L2 (Degradation Symptoms)

**Content Disposition**: MERGE two lessons

**Learning Objectives**:
- Apply discernment through Product, Process, and Performance evaluation
- Recognize context degradation symptoms (forgetting, repetition, vagueness)
- Execute multi-iteration refinement sessions
- Know when to restart vs. continue a session

**Key Content**:
- Discernment sub-components: Product, Process, Performance
- From old Ch11 L3:
  - Jake Heller's 60%→97% methodology
