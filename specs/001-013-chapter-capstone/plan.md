## Risk Mitigation

| Risk                                     | Mitigation                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Student doesn't achieve 50% acceleration | Retrospective addresses "why not" as valid learning  |
| Features too complex for time targets    | Keep features minimal viable—prototype quality       |
| ICP/Sales concepts unfamiliar            | Provide minimal necessary context, focus on building |
| Quiz too difficult                       | Balance questions across difficulty levels           |
