## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - MUST complete L00 before any other lessons
- **Cost Management (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2 - L01-L04 can be parallelized (different files)
- **Disaster Recovery (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 2 - L05-L06 can be parallelized (different files)
- **Resilience (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phase 2 - L07-L08 can be parallelized (different files)
- **Capstone (Phase 6)**: Depends on Phases 3-5 completion (synthesizes all concepts)
- **Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on all lessons being written

### Lesson Dependencies (within chapter)

- **L00**: No dependencies - MUST complete first (skill-first pattern)
- **L01**: Depends on L00 (skill exists for reflection)
- **L02**: Depends on L01 (cost fundamentals vocabulary)
- **L03**: Depends on L01-L02, Ch55 Prometheus
- **L04**: Depends on L03 (OpenCost installed)
- **L05**: Depends on L00 only (conceptual - no code prereqs)
- **L06**: Depends on L05 (RTO/RPO concepts)
- **L07**: Depends on L05-L06 (backup provides safety net)
- **L08**: Depends on L06 (Velero storage concepts)
- **L09**: Depends on ALL previous lessons (capstone integration)

### Parallel Opportunities

```bash
# After L00 completes, these can run in parallel:
T004 (L01), T005 (L02)  # Different files, cost focus
T008 (L05)              # Different file, backup focus (conceptual)

# After L01-L02 complete:
T006 (L03), T007 (L04)  # Different files, OpenCost + FinOps

# After L05-L06 complete:
T010 (L07), T011 (L08)  # Different files, chaos + compliance

# Validation phase - all parallel:
T013, T014, T015, T016, T017, T018  # Different validators, independent
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (L00 + L01 + L09)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: L00 (Skill-first - CRITICAL)
3. Implement L01 (Cloud Cost Fundamentals)
4. Implement L09 (Capstone - skeleton)
5. **VALIDATE**: Test skill creation and cost concepts
6. Iterate based on feedback

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + L00 -> Skill foundation ready
2. L01-L04 -> Cost management complete -> Test independently
3. L05-L06 -> Disaster recovery complete -> Test independently
4. L07-L08 -> Resilience complete -> Test independently
5. L09 -> Capstone integrates all -> Full chapter test
6. Phase 7 -> Validation -> Publication ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + L00 together
2. Once L00 is done:
   - Developer A: L01, L02
   - Developer B: L05, L06
   - Developer C: L07, L08
3. L03, L04 after L01-L02 complete
4. L09 after all lessons complete
5. Validation in parallel
