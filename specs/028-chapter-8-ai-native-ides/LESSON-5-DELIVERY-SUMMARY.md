## Key Teaching Innovations

### 1. Invisible Three Roles Framework

**What makes it work**:

- Students don't see role labels
- They experience all three roles through realistic multi-turn conversations
- "Building an Authentication Service Through Conversation" (4 messages) shows:
  - Message 1: User specifies requirements
  - Message 2: AI teaches (email verification pattern + schema implications)
  - Message 3: User teaches (security constraints + environment variable secrets)
  - Message 4: Integration (final assembly with all constraints)
- **Result**: Natural collaborative development, zero pedagogy exposition

### 2. Production Code Throughout

**Philosophy**: AI-native development teaches real patterns from day one.

**Examples**:

- Bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds minimum (security standard)
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry (authentication pattern)
- Rate limiting (production requirement)
- Flask routes with error handling (web framework standard)
- SQLAlchemy models with validation (ORM best practice)

**Why this matters**: B1 students need realistic examples they can apply immediately.

### 3. Spec-First Teaching Without Explicit Framework Exposition

**How it works**:

- Lesson teaches "write specifications first" through examples, not lectures
- "Designing Effective Prompts" section contrasts poor specs with effective specs
- Exercises practice specification writing (Exercise 1, 3, 6)
- Capstone project starts with complete specification
- Students learn "good specs = good AI outputs" through experience, not instruction

### 4. Context Management as Critical Skill

**Key insight**: AI works within a "context window" (working memory). Managing this efficiently is a production skill.

**How lesson teaches**:

- Explains what context includes (explicit files, implicit files, conversation history)
- Shows context optimization (removing unnecessary files, threading)
- Exercise 5: Hands-on context management practice
- Real limit: 200K tokens (helps students understand constraints)

---

## Learning Objectives Achievement

### Objective 1: Apply multi-turn conversations to solve iterative coding problems

**Where taught**:

- Section 1: "Understanding Multi-Turn Conversations"
- Example: "Building an Authentication Service" (4 messages)
- Exercises 1, 3, 8: Practice multi-turn dialogue

**How validated**: Capstone project demonstrates independent multi-turn conversation.

### Objective 2: Evaluate Cursor's diff editor for code review and modification

**Where taught**:

- Section 2: "Mastering the Diff Editor"
- Diff review checklist (8-point review process)
- Exercises 2, 7: Hands-on diff review and bug detection

**How validated**: Exercise 7 asks students to find bugs in diffs; capstone requires code review.

### Objective 3: Compose Claude Rules for consistent AI collaboration patterns

**Where taught**:

- Section 3 subsection: "Using Claude Rules for Consistency"
- Example: Project-specific rules (code style, error handling, testing)
- Exercise 4: Apply Claude Rules to prompt generation

**How validated**: Students see rules improve code quality immediately.

### Objective 4: Analyze context window management strategies

**Where taught**:

- Section 4: "Context Window Management"
- Optimization strategies (avoid unnecessary files, threading, summarization)
- Exercise 5: Hands-on context optimization in multi-file project

**How validated**: Students track context, reduce it, measure improvement.

### Objective 5: Design IDE workflows that leverage AI strengths

**Where taught**:

- Section 7: "Orchestrating Complex Features With Cursor"
- Thread-based orchestration (parallel work streams)
- Decision documentation (keep architectural choices visible)
- Exercises 8-9: Design workflows for multi-component features

**How validated**: Capstone project requires designing complete authentication workflow.

| Design IDE workflows           | Create           | ✅ YES (advanced B1) |

**Assessment**: Cognitive demand matches B1 profile (mostly Apply/Analyze, some Create).
