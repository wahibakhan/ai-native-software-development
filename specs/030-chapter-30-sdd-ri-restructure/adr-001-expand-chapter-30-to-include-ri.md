# ADR 001: Expand Chapter 30 to Unified SDD-RI Methodology (8 Lessons)

**Status**: Approved
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Decision Makers**: User (strategic), LoopFlow Orchestrator (constitutional analysis)
**Affects**: Chapter 30, Part 5 coherence, Part 6+ prerequisites

---

## Context

### The Problem

**Current State**: Chapter 30 "Understanding Spec-Driven Development" teaches 5 lessons on SDD fundamentals but omits Reusable Intelligence (RI) concepts.

**Gap Identified**: Book's actual methodology is **SDD-RI** (Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence), not pure SDD. Students reaching Part 6 (AI Native Software Development) encounter Skills, Subagents, and Intelligence Libraries without foundational understanding.

**Constitutional Violation**:

- **Principle 5 (Intelligence Accumulation)**: Part 6+ requires RI concepts as prerequisites
- **Pedagogical Arc**: Missing Integration phase where students learn to make specs reusable

### The Question

**Should we**:

- **Option A**: Expand Chapter 30 to include RI concepts (7-8 lessons total)?
- **Option B**: Create separate Chapter 31 for RI (requiring renumbering of Chapters 31-33 → 32-34)?

---

## Decision

**Expand Chapter 30 to 8 lessons** with staged progression:

- **Lessons 1-5**: SDD Fundamentals (Foundation → Application)
- **Lessons 6-8**: RI Extension (Integration → Validation)

**Learning Progression Strategy**: Late reveal (Option 2b)

- Students master single-spec SDD (L1-5) before encountering reusability patterns (L6-8)
- "Aha moment" at Lesson 6: "Now that you can write specs, let's make them reusable"

---

## Rationale

### Constitutional Grounding

**Principle 2 — Progressive Complexity (B1 Tier)**:

- Cognitive load limit: 7-10 concepts per section
- **SDD concepts (L1-5)**: ~5-7 concepts (spec.md structure, intent vs implementation, acceptance criteria, AI collaboration)
- **RI concepts (L6-8)**: ~3-4 concepts (Skills, Subagents, Persona+Questions+Principles, Intelligence Libraries)
- **Total**: 8-11 concepts distributed across 8 lessons = **~1.0-1.4 concepts per lesson** (well within B1 capacity)

**Principle 4 — Coherent Structure**:

- Pedagogical arc naturally maps to 8 lessons:
  1. **Foundation** (L1-2): What is SDD, why specifications matter
  2. **Application** (L3-5): Write specs with AI collaboration
  3. **Integration** (L6-7): Make specs reusable (RI patterns)
  4. **Validation** (L8): Evaluate SDD-RI tradeoffs, organizational patterns

**Principle 5 — Intelligence Accumulation**:

- **Prerequisite chain**: Part 6 (Agent building) → requires Skills/Subagents understanding → must teach RI in Part 5
- **Sequential dependency**: SDD foundation (write one spec) → RI extension (compose many specs)
- **No circular dependencies**: Students cannot learn "reusable specs" before learning "specs"

**Principle 6 — Anti-Convergence**:

- Previous Chapter 29: Technical deep dive (CPython/GIL), direct teaching
- Chapter 30 modality: **Specification-first teaching** (meta: teaching specs by writing specs)
- **Variation achieved**: Different modality from Ch 29

### Alternative Considered (Option B: Separate Chapter)

**Why rejected**:

- **Conceptual fragmentation**: SDD-RI is ONE unified methodology, not two separate topics
- **Organizational disruption**: Renumbering Chapters 31-33 → 32-34 affects:
  - All cross-references in Parts 6-12
  - Chapter-index.md structure (Part 5 becomes 5 chapters instead of 4)
  - Student mental model (Part 5 should be cohesive unit)
- **Pedagogical weakness**: Artificial separation implies SDD and RI are independent (they're not)

**When Option B would be better**:

- If RI concepts were 10+ new concepts (would exceed single-chapter load)
- If RI had no sequential dependency on SDD (could be learned independently)
- If Part 5 was designed as 5-chapter structure from the start

None of these conditions apply.

### Staged Progression (Late Reveal) Rationale

**Why not introduce RI in Lesson 1?**

Constitution Section IIa (4-Stage Framework) defines progression:

- **Stage 1 (Manual Foundation)**: Students build mental models through direct practice
- **Stage 2 (AI Collaboration)**: Students apply concepts with AI assistance
- **Stage 3 (Intelligence Design)**: Students create reusable components
- **Stage 4 (Spec-Driven Integration)**: Students orchestrate accumulated intelligence

**Mapping to Chapter 30**:

- **L1-2 (Stage 1)**: Manual spec-writing practice, building mental model of "what is a specification"
- **L3-5 (Stage 2)**: AI collaboration on specs, iterative refinement
- **L6-7 (Stage 3)**: Create reusable intelligence (Skills), understand Subagent patterns
- **L8 (Stage 3→4 bridge)**: Evaluate organizational patterns, prepare for capstone in Ch 31+

**Early introduction would violate Stage 1 principle**: Students cannot meaningfully understand "reusable specifications" before they've written ONE specification manually.

**Pedagogical benefit of late reveal**:

- **Motivation**: Students experience the pain of "writing similar specs repeatedly" (L3-5), making RI's value obvious when introduced (L6)
- **Cognitive scaffolding**: Each stage builds on previous, no cognitive overload
- **Aha moment**: "Wait, I can make this reusable?" is more powerful than "Here's reusability" upfront

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Conceptual Unity**: SDD-RI taught as single, coherent methodology
✅ **Prerequisite Fulfillment**: Part 6+ students arrive with RI foundation
✅ **No Structural Disruption**: Chapters 31-33 remain unchanged, no renumbering cascade
✅ **Cognitive Load Managed**: Progressive disclosure keeps each lesson within B1 limits
✅ **Pedagogical Elegance**: Meta-teaching (teaching specs using specification-first approach)
✅ **Constitutional Compliance**: All 7 principles satisfied

### Negative (Mitigated)

⚠️ **Longer Chapter**: 8 lessons vs typical 7-9 (within acceptable range for Part 5)

- **Mitigation**: Part 5 chapters are conceptually denser; 8 lessons justified by importance

⚠️ **Late RI Introduction**: Students don't see "full picture" until Lesson 6

- **Mitigation**: Stage-appropriate scaffolding; early intro would violate Stage 1 principle

⚠️ **Implementation Work**: Requires restructuring existing 5-lesson content

- **Mitigation**: Existing content remains (L1-5), only L6-8 are net-new

### Risks and Monitoring

**Risk 1**: Cognitive overload if concepts not properly chunked
**Monitoring**: Validate each lesson against B1 concept count (max 1-2 new concepts per lesson)
**Mitigation**: Use progressive disclosure, frequent practice checkpoints

**Risk 2**: Students confused by "late reveal" (feel misled)
**Monitoring**: Check lesson transitions for clarity and motivation
**Mitigation**: L5 ending sets up L6: "You've mastered specs. Next: making them reusable across projects."

**Risk 3**: Part 6 chapters assume too much RI knowledge
**Monitoring**: Validate Part 6 Chapter 34+ prerequisites align with Ch 30 L6-8 outputs
**Mitigation**: Explicit prerequisite documentation in chapter-index.md

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Lesson Structure Design

**New 8-Lesson Structure** (with concept mapping):

**Lessons 1-5: SDD Fundamentals** (existing content, minor updates)

- **L1**: Why Specifications Matter (Concepts: Vagueness cost, Intent vs Implementation)
- **L2**: Anatomy of a Spec (Concepts: spec.md structure, Evals-first, Acceptance criteria)
- **L3**: Writing Specs with AI (Concepts: AI as spec partner, Iterative refinement)
- **L4**: From Spec to Code (Concepts: Specification primacy, Validation loops)
- **L5**: Spec Quality & Tradeoffs (Concepts: Over/under-specification, Tooling landscape)

**Lessons 6-8: RI Extension** (net-new content)

- **L6**: Introduction to Reusable Intelligence (Concepts: Skills, Subagents, When to encode)
- **L7**: Designing Skills and Subagents (Concepts: Persona+Questions+Principles, Reasoning activation)
- **L8**: Organizational Patterns & Governance (Concepts: Constitutions, Intelligence Libraries, Spec-as-Source vision)

### Phase 2: Content Creation Tasks

**Existing Lessons (L1-5)**: Minor updates only

- Add forward reference in L5: "Next chapter: making specs reusable"
- Ensure examples are production-relevant (not toy apps)
- Validate cognitive load (max 1-2 concepts per lesson)

**New Lessons (L6-8)**: Full implementation

- L6: Create from scratch (intro to RI, Skills vs Subagents decision framework)
- L7: Implement Persona+Questions+Principles pattern teaching
- L8: Cover Constitutions (reference this project's constitution.md as example)

### Phase 3: Validation

**Cognitive Load Check**:

- [ ] Each lesson: 1-2 new concepts max (B1 compliance)
- [ ] Total chapter: 8-11 concepts distributed across 8 lessons

**Pedagogical Arc Check**:

- [ ] L1-2: Foundation (manual practice)
- [ ] L3-5: Application (AI collaboration)
- [ ] L6-7: Integration (reusability patterns)
- [ ] L8: Validation (evaluate tradeoffs)

**Prerequisite Chain Check**:

- [ ] Part 6 Chapter 34+ prerequisites satisfied by Ch 30 L6-8
- [ ] No forward references to concepts not yet taught
- [ ] Chapter-index.md updated with RI concepts in Ch 30 description

**Anti-Convergence Check**:

- [ ] Teaching modality different from Ch 29 (specification-first vs direct teaching)
- [ ] Examples production-relevant (not toy apps)
- [ ] Active reasoning prompts throughout (not passive reading)
