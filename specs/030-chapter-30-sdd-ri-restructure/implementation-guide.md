# Implementation Guide: Chapter 30 Restructuring to 8-Lesson SDD-RI

**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Target**: `apps/learn-app/docs/05-Spec-Driven-Development/30-specification-driven-development-fundamentals/`
**Change Type**: Expansion (5 lessons → 8 lessons)
**Implementation Effort**: Medium (3 net-new lessons, 5 minor updates)

---

## Overview

**What Changed**: Chapter 30 expands from 5 lessons (SDD only) to 8 lessons (unified SDD-RI methodology)

**Why Changed**: Book teaches "SDD-RI" but Chapter 30 only covered "SDD", creating prerequisite gap for Part 6+ (agent building)

**Impact**:

- **Lessons 1-5**: Minor updates (existing SDD content)
- **Lessons 6-8**: Net-new implementation (RI concepts)
- **Chapter README**: Update to reflect 8-lesson structure
- **Chapter-index.md**: Update Chapter 30 description to include RI

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Pre-Implementation)

- [ ] Practice exercise: Students collaborate with AI on intermediate feature
- [ ] Verify B1 cognitive load (1 concept: AI collaboration pattern)

**Constitutional Requirement** (Section IIa, Stage 2):

> Every Stage 2 lesson must include:
>

  ```markdown
  ## What's Next

  You've mastered writing individual specifications. But what happens when you write similar specs repeatedly across projects?

  In the next lesson, we'll explore **Reusable Intelligence (RI)**—the patterns and practices that make specifications composable and reusable, not just one-off documents.
  ```

**Validation**:

   - Intelligence Libraries: Organizational knowledge accumulation

3. **Decision Framework** (20 min)

   - **Frequency**: Pattern recurs 2+ times → consider encoding
   - **Complexity**: 2-4 decisions → Skill, 5+ → Subagent
   - **Organizational Value**: Applies across 3+ projects → worth encoding
   - Show decision tree diagram

4. **Real Examples** (15 min)

   - Skill example: `.claude/skills/learning-objectives/skill.md`

     - Good: "What attack surfaces exist? What threat vectors apply? How to prioritize?" (reasoning trigger)
   - **Principles**: Decision frameworks (not rigid rules)
     - Bad: "Use best practices" (meaningless)
     - Good: "Defense in depth: Never single control. Fail secure: Errors deny access."

3. **Guided Workshop** (40 min)

   - Students select RI opportunity from L6 analysis
   - **Step 1** (10 min): Write Persona
     - What cognitive stance activates right reasoning?
     - Review examples, draft, refine with AI
   - **Step 2** (15 min): Write Questions

### Phase 4: Chapter-Level Updates

#### Update Chapter README

**File**: `apps/learn-app/docs/05-Spec-Driven-Development/30-specification-driven-development-fundamentals/README.md`

**Changes Required**:

```markdown
# Chapter 30: Understanding Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence

Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI) bridges human creativity and AI precision: it turns vague ideas into executable contracts so coding agents can operate within clear boundaries and shared truths. By starting with specs—and making them reusable—we ensure AI coding agents build systems that are correct by design, traceable by memory, and governed by principle.

As AI-driven development matures, one thing is clear: its future will be written not in code, but in specifications and reusable intelligence.

Throughout this chapter you'll collaborate with your AI companion to co-create specifications, make them reusable through Skills and Subagents, and apply organizational patterns that scale to enterprise development.

## How to Work Through This Chapter

**You'll need**: Your AI coding assistant open alongside this book.

**The workflow**: When you see "Tell your companion:" or "Ask your companion:" prompts:

1. **Copy the prompt** and paste it into your AI tool
2. **Review the response** - does it make sense? Does it raise questions?
3. **Refine through dialogue** - ask follow-up questions, request clarifications
4. **Capture the results** - save collaborative specs and Skills in your project

This isn't passive reading—it's active collaboration. By the end, you'll have specifications, Skills, and even a simple Constitution you created with AI.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- **Diagnose vagueness**: Identify and quantify the real costs (time, rework, debugging, debt) caused by unclear requirements.
- **Write production-ready specs**: Produce executable specs with intent, requirements, acceptance criteria, and test scenarios.
- **Use AI as a spec partner**: Apply prompts and dialogues that reveal missing requirements, edge cases, and testable criteria.
- **Create reusable intelligence**: Design Skills and Subagents that encode recurring patterns using the Persona + Questions + Principles activation framework.
- **Apply organizational patterns**: Understand Constitutions, Intelligence Libraries, and how spec-as-source vision scales SDD-RI across teams.
- **Evaluate tools & patterns**: Choose appropriate tooling strategy for your team's scale and constraints.

## Chapter Structure (8 Lessons)

### Part 1: SDD Fundamentals (Lessons 1-5)

Foundation in writing individual specifications with AI collaboration.

### Part 2: Reusable Intelligence (Lessons 6-8)

Extension to organizational-scale patterns: Skills, Subagents, and Governance.
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Chapter description reflects 8-lesson structure

## Implementation Timeline

**Estimated Effort**:

- Phase 1 (Preparation): 1 hour
- Phase 2 (L1-5 updates): 3-5 hours
- Phase 3 (L6-8 creation): 10-15 hours
- Phase 4 (Chapter updates): 1 hour
- Phase 5 (Validation): 2-3 hours

**Total**: 17-25 hours (2-3 working days)

**Critical Path**:

2. L6 (RI introduction) — foundational for L7-8
3. L7 (P+Q+P workshop) — most complex lesson, requires careful scaffolding

---

## Success Criteria

**Implementation succeeds when**:

- ✅ All 8 lessons created/updated
- ✅ Cognitive load validation passes (B1 compliance)
- ✅ Constitutional compliance verified
- ✅ Prerequisite chain complete (Part 6 ready)
- ✅ Quality validation passes (content + pedagogy)
- ✅ Anti-pattern checks pass (no forbidden sections)

**Implementation fails if**:

- ❌ Any lesson exceeds 2 concepts (cognitive overload)
- ❌ L3 doesn't demonstrate Three Roles (constitutional violation)
- ❌ L6-8 missing or incomplete (Part 6 prerequisites unsatisfied)
- ❌ Examples are toy apps (not production-relevant)
- ❌ Anti-patterns present (standalone Safety Notes, "What's Next" sections)
