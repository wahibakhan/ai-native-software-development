## Lesson-by-Lesson Structure

### Lesson 1: Why Specifications Matter

**Stage**: 1 (Manual Foundation)
**Teaching Modality**: Problem-based discovery (show cost of vagueness)
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:

- Diagnose vagueness in requirements and quantify real costs (time, rework, debugging)
- Articulate the difference between intent and implementation
- Explain why AI agents need specifications (not just prompts)

**Concepts Introduced** (2):

1. **Vagueness Cost**: Time waste, rework cycles, technical debt from unclear requirements
2. **Intent vs Implementation**: WHAT the system does vs HOW it does it

**Content Structure**:

- **Problem**: Real-world case study of project failure due to vague requirements
- **Analysis**: Break down where vagueness entered, how it propagated
- **Principle**: Specifications capture intent before implementation
- **Practice**: Identify vagueness in sample requirement documents

**AI Role**: Minimal (student practices manual analysis)

**Cognitive Load**: 2 concepts, simple examples, heavy scaffolding = **Low (A2-B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Completed Part 4 (Python Fundamentals)
- Understands basic software development concepts
- Has experienced working with AI coding assistants (from Parts 1-3)

**Outputs**:

- Student can identify vague vs precise requirements

### Lesson 2: Why Do Specs Matter NOW? The AI Moment

**Stage**: 1 (Manual Foundation)
**Teaching Modality**: Historical context + motivational analysis
**Duration**: 60-75 minutes
**Status**: 🔄 NEEDS COMPRESSION (from existing L5, currently 2.5-3 hours)

**Learning Objectives**:

- Explain why SDD emerged NOW in 2025 (not in 1970s, 2000s, or 2010s)
- Connect AI literal-mindedness to specification necessity
- Understand cost-benefit shift: specs save time with AI agents

**Concepts Introduced** (3):

1. **Three Convergent Forces**: AI capability + iteration savings + AI literal-mindedness
2. **Historical Context**: Why previous spec approaches failed (Formal Methods, MDD, Agile backlash)
3. **AI Necessity**: AI agents need specs (humans can improvise, AI cannot)

**Content Structure**:

- **Part 1 (15 min)**: The Question

  - "Why is SDD standard NOW, not 20 years ago?"
  - Three convergent forces explanation

- **Part 2 (20 min)**: Historical Timeline (COMPRESSED)

  - 1970s Formal Methods: Too rigid (PhD-level math required)
  - 2000s Model-Driven Development: Tool lock-in, models diverged from code
  - 2010s Agile Backlash: Lost institutional knowledge
  - ONE SENTENCE per era (not detailed deep dive)

- **Part 3 (25 min)**: Why SDD Succeeds NOW

  - AI literal-mindedness (can't infer intent like humans)
  - Cost-benefit math: Before (12 hours) vs With SDD (4 hours)
  - Why MDD failed but SDD succeeds (natural language, LLMs, no lock-in)

- **Part 4 (10 min)**: Practice Exercise
  - Reflect: "When did I iterate 5+ times due to vague requirements?"
  - Calculate time savings for own projects

**AI Role**: Reflective partner (student asks: "Why did MDD fail but SDD succeeds?")

**Cognitive Load**: 3 concepts, historical context, motivational = **Medium (B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Lesson 1 completed (understands vague code problem)

**Outputs**:

- Understanding of WHY specs matter NOW (motivation for learning structure)
- Recognition that AI makes specs necessary, not optional
- **Transition to L3**: "Now you know WHY specs matter. L3 shows WHAT a good spec looks like."

**Implementation Note**: Compress existing L5 (264 lines) to ~150-180 lines by:

- Keeping three convergent forces (CRITICAL)
- Compressing historical timeline (1 sentence per era)
- Keeping AI literal-mindedness insight
- Keeping cost-benefit math
- Removing detailed MDD analysis, market validation timeline

**AI Role**: None (manual practice builds foundation)

**Cognitive Load**: 2 concepts + quality awareness, structured template = **Medium (B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Lesson 2 completed (understands WHY specs matter)

**Outputs**:

- Student's first manually-written spec.md file
- Quality self-assessment capability
- **Transition to L4**: "You can write a spec manually. L4 shows how to write better specs WITH AI."

**Quality Integration**: Add "Good vs Bad Spec" comparison section showing:

- ❌ Vague: "System should be fast" → ✅ Clear: "API response time <200ms for 95th percentile"
- ❌ Untestable: "UI should look good" → ✅ Testable: "All buttons have 8px padding, primary color #007bff"

---

### Lesson 4: Build Your First Spec Together (AI Collaboration)

**Stage**: 2 (AI Collaboration)
**Teaching Modality**: Three Roles Framework (AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker)
**Duration**: 60-75 minutes
**Status**: ✅ EXISTING (add quality iteration)

**Learning Objectives**:

- Use AI to generate initial specification draft
- Refine AI-generated specs through iterative dialogue
- Demonstrate AI as Teacher (suggests missing requirements), Student (learns constraints), Co-Worker (converges on solution)

**Concepts Introduced** (1):

1. **AI as Spec Partner**: Iterative refinement through collaboration

**Content Structure**:

- **Role 1 — AI as Teacher**: AI suggests edge cases student didn't consider
- **Role 2 — AI as Student**: Student corrects AI's generic assumptions with domain constraints
- **Role 3 — AI as Co-Worker**: Convergence loop produces better spec than either alone
- **Practice**: Write calculator spec collaboratively (reuses L3 quality checklist)
- **Quality Iteration** (NEW): Draft → Evaluate against quality checklist → Refine → Validate

**AI Role**: Active collaboration (Three Roles demonstrated)

**Cognitive Load**: 1 concept (AI collaboration pattern), builds on L1-3 foundation = **Medium (B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Lesson 3 completed (can write basic spec manually + knows quality checklist)
- Understands spec structure well enough to evaluate AI output

**Outputs**:

- Collaboratively-refined calculator spec.md
- Experience with bidirectional learning (student ↔ AI)
- Quality-validated spec (using L3 checklist)
- **Transition to L5**: "You can write specs with AI. L5 shows how to ensure consistency across TEAM specs."

**Constitutional Requirement**: MUST demonstrate all three roles (Teacher/Student/Co-Worker)

**Quality Integration**: After collaborative draft, add quality review step:

- Check against L3 checklist (Clear Intent? Testable? Complete?)
- Identify vagueness collaboratively with AI
- Refine until quality criteria met

---

### Lesson 5: Your Team Needs Shared Rules (Constitutions)

**Stage**: 2 (AI Collaboration)
**Teaching Modality**: Governance patterns introduction
**Duration**: 60-75 minutes
**Status**: ✅ EXISTING LESSON (add quality consistency emphasis)

**Learning Objectives**:

- Understand specification consistency across teams and projects
- Define a Constitution (governance document) that applies globally
- Apply constitutional rules to ensure quality at scale

**Concepts Introduced** (2):

1. **Constitutions**: Global governance rules for all specifications
2. **Governance Patterns**: Memory Banks, ADRs, PHRs (organizational knowledge capture)

**Content Structure**:

- **Problem**: Inconsistent specs across team (different formats, conflicting rules)
- **Solution**: Constitutions as meta-governance (rules about specs)
- **Examples**: Memory Banks (Kiro framework), Constitutions (Spec-Kit framework)
- **Practice**: Create simple team constitution (password hashing rules, error handling standards)
- **Quality at Scale** (NEW): Constitution ensures quality consistency
  - Every spec meets minimum quality bar
  - Team standards encode lessons learned
  - Prevents recurring quality issues

**AI Role**: Governance advisor (helps design constitution)

**Cognitive Load**: 2 concepts (governance patterns), builds on L1-4 = **Medium (B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Lesson 4 completed (has written individual specs with AI)
- Understands spec structure and quality (can create governance rules)

**Outputs**:

- Simple team constitution document
- Understanding of governance as quality enforcement + reusable intelligence foundation
- **Transition to L6**: "You can write consistent specs. But you notice patterns repeating (auth, validation, error handling). L6 shows how to make those patterns REUSABLE."

**Why Critical**: Constitutions are CORE to SDD-RI methodology and prerequisite for L6-7 (Skills/Subagents inherit constitutional thinking)

**Quality Integration**: Constitution as quality enforcement mechanism:

- Global rules ensure every spec meets standards
- Example: "All API specs must define error responses" (prevents quality gaps)
- Team learns from mistakes, encodes in Constitution

---

    - 2-4 decisions, horizontal (applies broadly) → **Skill**
    - 5+ decisions, vertical (domain-specific) → **Subagent**
    - Organizational rule (applies to ALL specs) → **Constitution** (already learned in L4)
  - Practice: Map patterns from L5 analysis to Skills/Subagents/Constitutions

**AI Role**: Pattern identifier (helps categorize which patterns are which type)

**Cognitive Load**: 2 concepts with concrete examples = **Medium (B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Lesson 5 completed (identified recurring patterns)
- Understands Constitutions (L4) as foundation

**Outputs**:

- Pattern identification worksheet: Which L1-5 patterns are Skills vs Subagents?
- Understanding of RI as methodology extension (not just tooling)

- Create 2 designed components: 1 Skill + 1 Subagent (documented, not implemented)

**Concepts Introduced** (1):

1. **Persona + Questions + Principles (P+Q+P)**: Reasoning activation pattern for RI design

**Content Structure**:

- **Part 1 (20 min)**: Design Walkthrough — "Input Validation Skill"

  ```markdown
  ### Persona

  You are a defensive programming specialist focused on preventing invalid input bugs.

  ### Questions to Ask

  1. What are valid input types? (string, int, float, list, dict)
  2. What are acceptable value ranges? (min/max, allowed values)
  3. What happens with invalid input? (raise ValueError, return None, default value)
  4. Should validation be strict (reject) or lenient (coerce)?

  ### Principles

  - Validate at system boundaries (API entry points, user input)
  - Fail fast with clear error messages
  - Use type hints + runtime validation for critical inputs
  - Document validation rules in spec.md
  ```

- **Part 2 (20 min)**: Design Walkthrough — "Performance Optimization Subagent"

  ```markdown
  ### Persona

  You are a performance engineer who reviews specifications for efficiency concerns.

  ### Questions to Ask (5+)

  1. What are expected data volumes? (10 records, 1M records, 1B records)
  2. What are latency requirements? (real-time <100ms, batch <1min, offline <1hr)
  3. Are there N+1 query risks? (database access patterns)
  4. Should results be cached? (frequency of identical requests)
  5. What are memory constraints? (loading all data vs streaming)

  ### Principles

  - Optimize for actual use case (premature optimization is waste)
  - Measure before optimizing (profile, don't guess)
  - Document performance requirements in Constraints section
  - Use appropriate data structures (O(1) lookup vs O(n) scan)
  ```

- **Part 3 (20 min)**: Practice — Student Designs 2 Components
  - Design "Security Review Subagent" using P+Q+P pattern
  - Design "API Design Skill" for consistent endpoint patterns
  - Critique: Which design is better and why?

**Why P+Q+P Pattern**:

- **Persona**: Activates domain expertise (security mindset, performance mindset)
- **Questions**: Prompts reasoning (not just pattern matching)
- **Principles**: Ensures consistency across applications

**AI Role**: Design critic (evaluates P+Q+P quality, suggests improvements)

**Cognitive Load**: 1 concept, 2 walkthroughs + practice = **Medium (B1)**

**Prerequisites**:

- Lesson 6 completed (understands Skills vs Subagents)
- Has pattern from L5-6 analysis to design

**Outputs**:

- 2 designed components (Skill + Subagent) documented using P+Q+P template
- Understanding that RI design ≠ RI implementation (design now, implement in Chapter 31+)

- Preparation for Chapter 31 implementation
- **NOT**: Framework selection decision (that's for their real projects later)

**Framing**: "Industry landscape awareness before implementation" (NOT "choose your framework NOW")

**Implementation Note**: Adapt existing L6 (359 lines) by:

- Preserving context assessment (lines 32-60)
- Compressing framework comparison (lines 63-244)
- Reframing as "landscape awareness" not "student choice"

- Target: ~200 lines, 60-75 minutes
- Preserve: Context assessment, framework comparison
- Reframe: "Landscape awareness" not "student choice"
- Add: Chapter 31 bridge
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

**Total Remaining**: 15-20 hours of implementation

### Validation Checklist (Per Lesson)

- [ ] Learning objectives measurable and achievable
- [ ] Concept count within B1 limit (1-2 per lesson)
- [ ] Teaching modality identified and varied from adjacent lessons
- [ ] AI role appropriate for stage (Manual → Collaboration → Co-design)
- [ ] Prerequisites satisfied by prior lessons
- [ ] Outputs feed into next lesson or part
- [ ] Practical examples (students create artifacts, not just read theory)
- [ ] Clear boundary: Understanding (Chapter 30) vs Framework implementation (Chapter 31+)

## Summary

**This lesson plan operationalizes the strategic decision to teach SDD-RI as unified methodology through 8 progressively-structured lessons with practical learning focus.**

### Key Principles

1. **Practical Learning Through Examples**: Students write specs, see real examples, practice workflows
2. **Clear Scope Boundary**: Chapter 30 = Understanding SDD-RI | Chapter 31+ = Framework implementation
3. **Artifact Creation**: Students produce tangible outputs (specs, constitutions, Skills/Subagents designs)
4. **B1 Cognitive Load**: 1-2 concepts per lesson, example-driven teaching
5. **Constitutional Alignment**: 4-Stage progression, Three Roles Framework, Intelligence Accumulation

### What Students Can Do After Chapter 30

✅ Write clear specifications manually and with AI collaboration
✅ Identify vague vs precise requirements in any spec
✅ Recognize recurring patterns across multiple specifications
✅ Design reusable intelligence using P+Q+P pattern
✅ Create governance rules (constitutions for consistency)
✅ Understand complete SDD-RI methodology (ready for framework implementation in Chapter 31+)

### What Students CANNOT Do Yet (Chapter 31+ Content)

❌ Use Spec-Kit framework to generate code from specs
❌ Build actual Skills/Subagents in code
❌ Deploy SDD-RI pipelines with CI/CD integration
❌ Implement Spec-as-Source workflows at scale

**Chapter 30 builds the mental model. Chapter 31+ provides the implementation tools.**
