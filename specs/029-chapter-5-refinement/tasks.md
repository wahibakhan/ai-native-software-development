## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Metadata)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Easy Content)**: Should complete Phase 1 first (establishes metadata foundation)
- **Phase 3 (Medium Content)**: Can run in parallel with Phase 2 (different lessons)
- **Phase 4 (Critical Reductions)**: Should complete Phases 2-3 first (build confidence before high-risk edits)
- **Phase 5 (Validation)**: Depends on Phases 1-4 completion (validate final state)

### Task Dependencies Within Phases

**Phase 1**: T001-T009 all parallel → T010-T012 validation (sequential after T001-T009)

**Phase 2**:

- T014-T016 (Lesson 2) can run parallel with T017-T019 (Lesson 3)
- T020-T021 (Lesson 7) can run parallel with T022-T023 (Lesson 8)
- T024-T027 (README) can run parallel with any lesson tasks

**Phase 3**:

- T028-T030 (Lesson 4) can run parallel with T031-T034 (Lesson 5)

**Phase 4**:

- T035-T044 (Lesson 6) can run parallel with T045-T056 (Lesson 9)
- CAUTION: Both are HIGH RISK, may be safer to do sequentially to avoid context-switching errors

**Phase 5**:

- T057-T064 (sandbox tests) all parallel
- T065-T075 (verification) sequential after sandbox tests complete

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1: All Metadata Tasks

```bash
# Launch all 9 metadata additions together:
T001: "Add metadata to 01-origin-story.md"
T002: "Add metadata to 02-installation-and-authentication.md"
T003: "Add metadata to 03-claude-md-context-files.md"
T004: "Add metadata to 04-mcp-integration.md"
T005: "Add metadata to 05-subagents-and-orchestration.md"
T006: "Add metadata to 06-agent-skills.md"

T008: "Add metadata to 08-settings-hierarchy.md"
T009: "Add metadata to 09-plugins-putting-it-all-together.md"
```

#### Phase 2: Easy Refinements

T020-T021: "Lesson 7 Three Roles"
T022-T023: "Lesson 8 methodology"
T024-T027: "README Stage Progression"
```

#### Phase 5: Sandbox Tests

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Phases 1-2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Metadata Enhancement (2-3 hours)
2. Complete Phase 2: Easy Content Refinement (3-4 hours)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Docusaurus build, verify metadata, check line counts
4. **DECISION POINT**: Proceed to Phases 3-4 (critical reductions) or stop if satisfactory

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Phase 1 → Metadata foundation ready
2. Complete Phase 2 → Easy enhancements done (Lessons 1-3, 7-8, README)
3. Complete Phase 3 → Medium refinements done (Lessons 4-5)
4. Complete Phase 4 → Critical reductions done (Lessons 6, 9) — HIGHEST RISK
5. Complete Phase 5 → Full validation → Publication ready

### Sequential Strategy (Safer for HIGH RISK phases)

With single implementer (recommended for quality):

1. Complete Phases 1-3 (metadata + easy/medium content)
2. Tackle Lesson 6 reduction alone (90 min focused work)
3. Validate Lesson 6 against learning objectives
4. Tackle Lesson 9 reduction alone (120 min focused work)
5. Validate Lesson 9 against learning objectives
6. Run comprehensive validation (Phase 5)

---

## Rollback Points

If critical reductions (Phase 4) fail to preserve learning objectives:

**Lesson 6 Rollback**:

- Revert to post-Phase-1 state (metadata-only changes)
- Alternative strategy: Aim for less aggressive reduction (547 → 400 lines instead of 330)
- Accept 400-line limit as acceptable (still within constitutional range)

**Lesson 9 Rollback**:

- Revert to post-Phase-1 state (metadata-only changes)
- Alternative strategy: Preserve marketplace catalog, cut other sections less aggressively
- Accept 500-line limit if essential (with justification in ADR)

**Validation Failures (Phase 5)**:

- If code examples fail: Fix commands/workflows, re-test
- If metadata invalid: Fix YAML syntax, re-validate
- If concept counts wrong: Recount, update metadata
- Document all fixes in SANDBOX-AUDIT-REPORT.md

---

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative** (from spec.md):

- ✅ 9/9 lessons have complete metadata (100% coverage)
- ✅ Lesson 6 ≤340 lines, Lesson 9 ≤400 lines
- ✅ Average lesson length 250-350 lines
- ✅ Theory-to-practice ratio ≥60% hands-on
- ✅ All concept counts within tier limits (A2: ≤7, B1: ≤10)
- ✅ 100% code examples sandbox-tested and verified
- ✅ 100% feature claims cited from official docs

**Qualitative** (from spec.md):

- ✅ README stage progression explicit with visual diagram
- ✅ "Why This Matters" sections methodology-focused (not features)
- ✅ Three Roles examples demonstrate authentic co-learning
- ✅ Reduced lessons (6, 9) maintain learning objective clarity
- ✅ Chapter arc (L1→L2→L3→L4) clear and traceable

**Constitutional Compliance**:

- ✅ Specification Primacy: Methodology before features
- ✅ Progressive Complexity: A2-B1 tier limits enforced
- ✅ Factual Accuracy: All code tested, all claims cited
- ✅ Coherent Structure: L1→L2→L3→L4 progression visible
- ✅ Intelligence Accumulation: Lessons build toward capstone
- ✅ Anti-Convergence: Surgical targeting (not uniform refinement)
- ✅ Minimal Content: Non-goals honored (no new lessons, no comprehensive docs)

---

## Total Task Count

**Phase 1**: 12 tasks (9 parallel metadata + 3 validation)
**Phase 2**: 15 tasks (lesson enhancements + README)
**Phase 3**: 7 tasks (Lessons 4 & 5 medium refinement)
**Phase 4**: 22 tasks (Lessons 6 & 9 critical reductions)
**Phase 5**: 19 tasks (sandbox testing + verification)

**TOTAL**: 75 tasks distributed across 5 phases

**Parallel Opportunities**:

- Phase 1: 9 tasks parallel
- Phase 2: 5 task groups parallel
- Phase 3: 2 task groups parallel
- Phase 5: 8 tasks parallel

**Critical Path**: Phase 1 → Phase 4 (Lesson 6) → Phase 4 (Lesson 9) → Phase 5 (validation)

**Estimated Duration**: 14-19 hours (per plan.md)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- **Metadata template** (Phase 1): See plan.md for exact YAML structure per lesson
- **"Why This Matters" template** (Phases 2-4): 80-150 words, methodology-focused (workflow impact + paradigm connection + real-world context)
- **Three Roles template** (Phases 2-4): AI teaches → Student teaches → Convergence loop (explicit demonstration)
- **Line count verification**: Use `wc -l` on each lesson file
- **Theory-to-practice ratio**: Count explanatory paragraphs vs. practice blocks (🤝 exercises, 💬 AI prompts, code "Try this")
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each phase completion (not individual tasks) to enable clean rollbacks
- **Validation gates**: Do NOT proceed to next phase if current phase validation fails
- **Risk tolerance**: If Phase 4 (critical reductions) feels unsafe, revert and accept higher line counts with ADR justification
