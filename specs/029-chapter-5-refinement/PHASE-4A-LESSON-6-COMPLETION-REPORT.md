## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Initial Over-Reduction

**Problem**: First reduction pass resulted in 232 lines (98 lines under target)
**Cause**: Removed too many examples and practical sections
**Solution**: Restored essential content:

- Added back "More Skill Ideas" (with 3 examples)
- Added back practical PDF skill example (streamlined)
- Added back decision framework section
- Added reflection on paradigm shift

### Challenge 2: Balancing Reduction vs Substance

**Approach**:

- Removed verbosity (redundant explanations, over-detailed walkthroughs)
- Preserved substance (learning objectives, key concepts, practical examples)
- Used visual tools (tables) which are more efficient than prose

## Recommendations for Review

1. **Verify Comparison Table Clarity**: Check that skills vs subagents table is immediately understandable without verbose explanations
2. **Test Hands-On Walkthrough**: Ensure blog-planner SKILL.md example is complete enough for students to replicate
3. **Validate Three Roles Example**: Confirm Step 4 co-learning section adequately demonstrates AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker
4. **Check "Why This Matters" Connection**: Verify organizational capability context connects to Chapter 5's overall methodology focus
