## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational Lessons (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS subsequent phases
- **Gateway API Core (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion
- **Production Features (Phase 4)**: Depends on L06 completion
- **Intelligence Lessons (Phase 5)**: Depends on L09 completion
- **Capstone (Phase 6)**: Depends on L00-L11 completion
- **Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on all lessons complete

### Lesson Dependencies (Sequential within phases)

**Phase 2**: L00 → L01 → L02 (sequential, manual foundation)
**Phase 3**: L03 → L04 → L05 → L06 (sequential, Gateway API learning curve)
**Phase 4**: L07, L08, L09 can run in parallel after L06
**Phase 5**: L10 → L11 (L11 depends on L10 resilience context)
**Phase 6**: L12 requires all L00-L11 complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 4 (after L06 complete)**:
```
Task: "L07 TLS Termination with CertManager" [P]
Task: "L08 Traffic Splitting Patterns" [P]
Task: "L09 Autoscaling with HPA, VPA & KEDA" [P]
```

**Within Phase 7 (after all lessons)**:
```
Task: "T019 Run factual-verifier" [P]
Task: "T020 Update README" [P]
Task: "T021 Create _category_.json" [P]
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 4 Lessons

```bash
# After L06 completes, launch L07, L08, L09 in parallel:
Task: content-implementer for L07 TLS Termination
Task: content-implementer for L08 Traffic Splitting
Task: content-implementer for L09 Autoscaling
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Lessons 00-06 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational Lessons L00-L02 (T005-T007)
3. Complete Phase 3: Gateway API Core L03-L06 (T008-T011)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test lessons work, code examples execute
5. Students can complete Gateway API fundamentals

### Full Chapter Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational + Gateway API Core → Core complete
2. Add Production Features L07-L09 → Students can secure and scale
3. Add Intelligence L10-L11 → Students recognize patterns
4. Add Capstone L12 → Students integrate all patterns
5. Validation Phase → Chapter ready for review

### Skill-First Validation

After each phase:
1. Verify student's traffic-engineer skill improves
2. Test skill generates valid YAML for concepts learned
3. "Reflect on Your Skill" sections match lesson content
