## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

### Principle 1: Specification Primacy ✅

- **Requirement**: PR description is specification of changes BEFORE merging
- **Implementation**: Lesson emphasizes "Summary → What Changed → Why → Testing" pattern
- **Validation**: PR template (Concept 2) shows spec elements
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

### Principle 2: Progressive Complexity ✅

- **Target Tier**: A2 (Aspiring intermediate)
- **Concept Count**: 4 concepts (within A2 limit of 5-7)
  1. Pull request creation
  2. PR diff review
  3. PR description documentation
  4. Merge workflow
- **Scaffolding**: Heavy (step-by-step GitHub interface navigation with screenshots implied)
- **Cognitive Load**: ✅ PASS (4 ≤ 7)

### Principle 3: Factual Accuracy ✅

- **Git Commands**: Not applicable (PR is GitHub feature, not Git command)
- **GitHub Features**: All features described (PR creation, diff view, merge button) are standard GitHub functionality
- **PR Best Practices**: Aligned with GitHub documentation standards
- **Status**: ✅ PASS (no hallucinated features)

### Principle 4: Coherent Structure ✅

- **Arc**: Understand PR → Create PR → Review Diff → Merge PR
- **Progression**: Linear, each section builds on previous
  - Opening: Framing PRs as safety + professional practice
  - Concept 1: What is PR and why it matters
  - Concept 2: PR description template (NEW - AI transparency critical)
  - Concept 3: Reviewing diffs (safety check)
  - Three Roles: Iterating on PR quality
  - Hands-on Activities 1-4: Complete workflow
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

### Principle 5: Intelligence Accumulation ✅

### Principle 6: Anti-Convergence ✅

- **Previous Chapters**: Chapter 7 (Bash) used direct teaching with analogies
- **This Chapter**: Hands-on discovery (execute → observe → understand)
- **Within Chapter**: Lesson 5 uses Three Roles (vs Lessons 1-2 hands-on discovery)
- **Teaching Modality Variation**: ✅ PASS (no identical consecutive modalities)

### Principle 7: Minimal Content ✅

- **Scope**: Every section maps to learning objective
  - "Understanding PRs" → LO1 (create PR)
  - "Concept 1" → LO1 (PR creation)
  - "Concept 2" → LO3 (document AI assistance) + LO4 (merge)
  - "Concept 3" → LO2 (review diff)
  - "Three Roles" → LO3 (AI transparency iteration)
  - "Activities 1-4" → All LOs (complete workflow)

## Stage 2 (AI Collaboration) Validation

### Three Roles Framework: Mandatory Demonstrations ✅

**Requirement**: All Stage 2 lessons MUST demonstrate AI as Teacher, Student, and Co-Worker with explicit callouts.

**Implementation**:

#### Role 1: AI as Teacher ✅

**Location**: "Three Roles in Action" section, subsection "Role 1: AI as Teacher"

**Scenario**:

```markdown
You create basic PR description (minimal)
↓
AI suggests (via prompt): "Your PR is good start, but missing:

- Which functions did AI generate?
- What edge cases tested?
- Did you find bugs?"
  ↓
  What You Learned: Transparency includes specifics, not just "used AI"
```

**Validation**:

- ✅ AI suggests pattern student didn't know (PR transparency best practices)
- ✅ Explicit callout: "What You Learned"
- ✅ Clear teaching moment (professionalizing AI attribution)

#### Role 2: AI as Student ✅

**Location**: "Three Roles in Action" section, subsection "Role 2: AI as Student"

**Scenario**:

```markdown
AI writes technical description (jargon-heavy)
↓
Student corrects: "Too technical, needs plain language"
↓
AI adapts: Simplifies to user-friendly language
↓
What AI Learned: PR reviewed by non-technical stakeholders needs clarity
```

**Validation**:

- ✅ Student teaches AI (provides corrective feedback)
- ✅ AI learns and adapts (revises description)
- ✅ Explicit callout: "What AI Learned"
- ✅ Demonstrates student as domain expert

#### Role 3: AI as Co-Worker (Convergence) ✅

**Location**: "Three Roles in Action" section, subsection "Role 3: AI as Co-Worker"

**Scenario**:

```markdown
Iteration 1: Basic PR + AI suggestions
Iteration 2: Student adds testing feedback
Iteration 3: AI suggests documentation structure
Iteration 4: Convergence - neither alone would create this quality
```

**Validation**:

- ✅ Iteration shows neither had perfect solution initially
- ✅ Convergence through feedback loop
- ✅ Final PR is better than either alone would create
- ✅ Explicit: "Why This Is Co-Working" explanation
- ✅ Clear convergence outcome

```

**Validation**:

- ✅ Shows specific AI contributions
- ✅ Shows student improvements/bug fixes
- ✅ Explains WHY student modified (transparency of reasoning)
- ✅ Demonstrates collaborative pattern

#### Transparency Emphasized Throughout ✅

- **PR Best Practices Section**: "Don't hide or omit AI usage (transparency is strength)"
- **Three Roles Iteration**: "neither you would write alone" → AI helps, student validates
- **Professional Pattern**: "Let AI generate... Review and test... Document what AI did vs. what you did"

**Validation**:

- ✅ Transparency framed as ethical + professional strength
- ✅ Not hiding AI, but integrating it transparently

---

## Critical Success: AI Transparency (SC-008)

**Requirement**: 100% of capstone PRs must include AI attribution

**This Lesson Establishes Foundation**:

1. **Template** (mandatory in all PRs):

   - AI Tool Used: [explicit naming]
   - What AI Generated: [specific list]
   - What I Modified: [specific list with reasons]

2. **Example** (realistic pattern):

   - Shows AI generating try/except blocks
   - Shows student finding edge case bugs
   - Shows student simplifying error messages
   - Transparency: "AI generated X, I modified Y because Z"

3. **Three Roles Iteration** (quality improvement process):

   - Basic PR → "missing what AI generated and what you tested"
   - Student adds testing feedback
   - Convergence → detailed, transparent final PR

4. **Practice Prompts**:
   - "Ask ChatGPT to review your PR description"
   - Learn what transparency looks like

**When Students Reach Lesson 7**:

- They have template (use it)
- They have example (follow pattern)
- They have experienced Three Roles (do it again)
- They have practiced prompts (reinforce habit)

**Result**: ✅ Students will document AI assistance in 100% of Lesson 7 capstone PRs

---

## Recommendations for Instructors

1. **Emphasize Transparency**: Frame AI attribution as strength, not weakness
2. **Real Examples**: Show your own GitHub PRs with AI attribution if possible
3. **Practice Iteration**: Use Three Roles scenario to show PR improvement over iterations
4. **Test the Workflow**: Create a test PR during lesson preparation
5. **Connect to Lesson 7**: Remind students this template will be required in capstone

---

## Recommendations for Students

1. **Create Your Own PR**: Don't just read—practice with your own feature branch
2. **Review Diffs Carefully**: Especially for AI-generated code (it has patterns)
3. **Be Specific in Transparency**: Don't just "used ChatGPT"—say WHAT and WHY
4. **Test Edge Cases**: AI often misses them—find them, fix them, document it
5. **Use the Template**: Copy-paste PR template into GitHub, fill out each section
