# Lesson 6 Implementation Verification Report

**Lesson**: 06-reusable-git-patterns.md
**Chapter**: 8 (Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development)
**Stage**: 3 (Intelligence Design)
**Date**: 2025-11-17
**Status**: COMPLETE & VERIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

Lesson 6 successfully implements **Stage 3 (Intelligence Design)** using the **Persona + Questions + Principles framework** to help students synthesize recurring Git workflow patterns into reusable documentation.

**Key Achievement**: Students transform tacit knowledge (patterns used in Lessons 1-5) into explicit, reusable intelligence (`git-workflow.md`) that they apply to novel scenarios without lesson reference.

---

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

### Principle 1: Specification Primacy ✅

- **Verification**: Lesson clearly shows WHAT patterns students will recognize and WHY before asking them to create documentation
- **Evidence**: Part 1 frames pattern recognition; Part 2 provides template structure; Part 3 applies to new context
- **Status**: COMPLIANT

### Principle 2: Progressive Complexity (A2 Cognitive Tier) ✅

- **Concept Count**: 3 new concepts (pattern recognition, documentation, application)
- **Limit**: A2 tier supports 5-7 concepts per section (intelligence design synthesis is 3 concepts)
- **Scaffolding**: Heavy—template provided, personalization encouraged, step-by-step application
- **Options**: Max 2 per pattern (keep vs discard in Pattern 2; commit Pattern 1 vs branch Pattern 2)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (3 concepts well within A2 limits)

### Principle 3: Factual Accuracy ✅

- **Verification**: All Git commands reference tested patterns from Lessons 1-5
- **Evidence**: Commands use proven syntax (git add, git commit, git branch, git merge, git push)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (no unverified commands introduced)

### Principle 4: Coherent Pedagogical Structure ✅

- **Arc**: Pattern Recognition → Documentation → Application (Foundation → Integration → Application)
- **Progression**: 20 min reflection → 30 min template creation → 10 min application
- **Bloom's**: Create (pattern recognition) → Create (documentation) → Apply (to novel context)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (logical arc following Bloom's cognitive levels)

### Principle 5: Intelligence Accumulation ✅

- **Source Context**: References all Lessons 1-5 patterns explicitly
- **Intelligence Created**: `git-workflow.md` template as reusable documentation
- **Application**: Applied to authentication feature scenario (novel context)
- **Carry Forward**: Students use this in Lesson 7 capstone
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (creates reusable skill for future use)

### Principle 6: Anti-Convergence Variation ✅

- **Chapter 7 Modality**: Direct teaching (explain → demonstrate → practice)
- **Chapter 8 Overall**: Hands-on discovery + Three Roles + Persona+Q+P + Spec-first
- **Lesson 6 Modality**: Persona + Questions + Principles (reflecting on own experience, creating documentation)
- **Difference**: NOT lecture-style, NOT Three Roles demonstration, UNIQUE to Stage 3
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (distinctive modality varying from earlier chapters)

### Principle 7: Minimal Sufficient Content ✅

- **Section 1 (Recognition)**: Reflection activity linked directly to pattern identification
- **Section 2 (Documentation)**: Template aligned to 3 core patterns from L1-5 (no tangential content)
- **Section 3 (Application)**: Scenario uses documented patterns without adding new concepts
- **Try With AI**: Extends without adding scope bloat (validation, extension, application)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT (all sections justify their presence through learning objectives)

## Stage 3 (Intelligence Design) Verification

### Persona + Questions + Principles Framework Applied ✅

#### Persona Definition (Part 2)

```
"Think like a Git safety engineer who prevents catastrophic mistakes.
Your mission: capture the workflow decisions that keep code safe."
```

- ✅ Clearly defined cognitive stance
- ✅ Activates context-specific reasoning (safety engineering, not generic documentation)
- ✅ Differentiates from Students-as-learners to Students-as-documentation-architects

#### Questions Structure (Throughout)

- **Recognition Questions** (Part 1): "What did you do BEFORE every AI change?" → Forces reflection on own experience
- **Creation Questions** (Part 2): "Questions to Ask Myself" in each pattern → Guides thoughtful documentation
- **Application Questions** (Part 3): "Did you need to refer back to Lessons 1-5?" → Validates documentation sufficiency
- ✅ Questions activate reasoning mode (WHY, WHEN, HOW) not prediction mode (IF...THEN)

#### Principle Articulation (Part 2)

Each pattern includes explicit **Principles** section:

- Pattern 1: "Commit Intentionally," "Message Clarity," "Selective Staging"
- Pattern 2: "Parallel Safety," "Test Before Commit," "Easy Discard"
- Pattern 3: "Backup Discipline," "Verify Backup," "Frequency"
- ✅ Principles guide decision-making, not prescriptive rules
- ✅ Each principle has reasoning framework (WHY each principle exists)

### Intelligence Design Criteria ✅

#### 1. Pattern Recurrence (2+ times in L1-5) ✅

- **Pattern 1 (Commit Before Experiment)**: L1-2 explicitly teach this; used in L3-5 setup
- **Pattern 2 (Branch-Test-Merge)**: L3 explicitly teaches; L4-5 apply this pattern
- **Pattern 3 (Push-for-Backup)**: L4 teaches push; L4-5 practice regularly
- All three patterns recurred 2+ times across lessons

#### 2. Decision Complexity (Justifies encoding) ✅

- **Pattern 1**: Teaches what to commit, when, how to message → ~4 decisions
- **Pattern 2**: Branch creation, testing strategy, merge vs discard → ~5 decisions
- **Pattern 3**: Push frequency, verification, recovery → ~4 decisions
- Encoded as **Skills** (guidance documents) not subagents (minimal complexity, but worth documenting)

#### 3. Cross-Project Applicability ✅

- **Pattern 1**: Applies to ANY AI-assisted project
- **Pattern 2**: Applies to testing ANY feature decisions
- **Pattern 3**: Applies to ANY remote backup strategy
- All patterns are **universally reusable** across different project types

#### 4. Format Choice: Markdown Guide (vs Claude Code skill) ✅

- **Reasoning**: Per spec.md clarification note, Option A (Simple Markdown Guide) selected for A1/A2 tier
- **Rationale**:
  - Accessible to beginners (no meta-complexity of skill syntax)
  - Portable (any text editor, any system)
  - Directly applicable without tool dependency
  - Will evolve to Claude Code skill format in Part 5 (Spec-Driven Development)
- **Format**: `git-workflow.md` in project root (transportable across projects)

## Pattern Recognition → Documentation → Application Flow

### Part 1: Recognition (20 min) ✅

- **Reflection Activity**: Students answer 3 questions about their L1-5 experience
- **Validation**: Expected answers confirm pattern occurrence
- **Discovery**: Students recognize patterns are NOT random but systematic
- **Output**: List of 3+ recurring patterns identified

### Part 2: Documentation (30 min) ✅

- **Template Provided**: `git-workflow.md` with 3 sections (one per pattern)
- **Persona Framing**: "Think like a Git safety engineer"
- **Three Questions per Pattern**:
  - When to use (decision criteria)
  - How to apply (step-by-step)
  - Questions to ask myself (reasoning framework)
- **Principles Section**: Each pattern includes explicit principles
- **Personalization**: Encouraged to write in own language, add patterns
- **Output**: Personal `git-workflow.md` reference document

### Part 3: Application (10 min) ✅

- **Novel Scenario**: AI authentication system (3 approaches to test)
- **Constraint**: Use ONLY `git-workflow.md` documentation (no lesson reference)
- **Challenge**: Complete full workflow (init → branch → test → decide → push)
- **Reflection**: Ask if documentation was sufficient
- **Output**: Applied workflow to new context; validation that documentation works

---

## Teaching Approach Validation

### Hands-On Discovery Modality (Stage 1-2 Legacy) → Stage 3 Distinct ✅

**Stage 1-2 Modality** (Lessons 1-5): Execute → Observe → Understand

**Stage 3 Modality** (Lesson 6): **Reflect → Document → Apply** (DIFFERENT)

**Why Different**:

- Not hands-on discovery of new Git commands (students already learned L1-5)
- Instead: Metacognitive reflection on OWN patterns + documentation creation + transfer to novel context
- Activates reasoning: "What patterns recur?", "Why are they important?", "How would I explain to future me?"

**Status**: ✅ DISTINCT FROM EARLIER LESSONS

---

## Constitutional Enforcement Checks

### Stage 1 (L1-2): Manual Foundation ✅

- No AI assistance in executing Git operations
- Students own the learning
- Foundation established for Stages 2-3

### Stage 2 (L3-5): AI Collaboration ✅

- Three Roles demonstrated in each lesson
- Bidirectional learning (AI teaches, student teaches)
- Convergence loops shown

### Stage 3 (L6): Intelligence Design ✅

- Persona + Questions + Principles framework applied
- Students create reusable documentation
- Apply to novel context WITHOUT lesson reference
- **THIS LESSON COMPLIANT**

### Stage 4 (L7): Spec-Driven (Upcoming)

- Will write spec.md FIRST
- Use accumulated skills from L1-6
- Orchestrate through spec

---

## Quality Metrics

### Readability & Clarity ✅

- **Language**: Plain English, avoiding jargon
- **Examples**: Concrete (password-based vs token-based authentication)
- **Structure**: Clear 3-part progression with time estimates
- **Accessibility**: A2 tier appropriate (heavy scaffolding, step-by-step)

### Completeness ✅

- **Coverage**: All 3 patterns from L1-5 explicitly addressed
- **Depth**: Each pattern includes when/how/why/questions/principles
- **Extensibility**: Space for students to add Pattern 4+ as they discover

### Reusability ✅

- **Template**: Standalone `git-workflow.md` portable across projects
- **Customization**: Encouraged to personalize with own language
- **Evolution**: Designed to grow as students encounter new patterns

### Validation Potential ✅

- **Application Scenario**: Concrete (authentication system, 3 approaches)
- **Reflection Questions**: Require metacognitive thinking, not pattern retrieval
- **Try With AI**: Three different validation approaches (review, extend, apply)

---

## Potential Student Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge 1: Over-Documentation

**Student Risk**: "My workflow documentation is so detailed it becomes overwhelming"
**Mitigation**: Part 2 explicitly says "write in your own words" + "Keep this simple" implicit in template

### Challenge 2: Pattern Over-Abstraction

**Student Risk**: "I can't think of 3 patterns I actually used"
**Mitigation**: Part 1 provides 3 explicit reflection questions with expected answers to guide discovery

### Challenge 3: Documentation Insufficiency

**Student Risk**: "My git-workflow.md didn't help me in Part 3"
**Mitigation**: Try With AI Exercise 1 (Validation Review) specifically asks AI to identify gaps

### Challenge 4: Novel Scenario Ambiguity

**Student Risk**: "I'm not sure if the authentication scenario requires branching or not"
**Mitigation**: Decision Framework in Part 2 explicitly addresses "Branch or Commit?" question

## What Happens Next (Integration with Lesson 7)

### Lesson 7 (Capstone) Builds On Lesson 6 ✅

**L6 Deliverable**: `git-workflow.md` (reusable personal reference)

**L7 Usage**:

- Students use L6 workflow to manage capstone project
- Task Manager CLI generated by AI
- Multi-file project managed through Git workflow documented in L6
- See plan.md lines 614-615: "Will use L6 workflow documentation in capstone"

**Validation**:

- Capstone project history shows Patterns 1-3 applied
- Students can explain: "I used Pattern 2 (branch-test-merge) to test two implementations"
