## II. Stage 2 (AI Collaboration) - Three Roles Verification

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All Three Roles Must Be Demonstrated ✓

#### Role 1: AI as Teacher ✓

- **Requirement**: AI suggests pattern student didn't explicitly ask about
- **Location**: "Role 1: AI as Teacher — Learning Dual Backup+Portfolio Value" (Part 2)
- **Implementation**:
  - Student asks: "How do I back up my code to GitHub?"
  - AI suggests: "GitHub isn't just backup—it's also your portfolio"
  - **What student learns**: Dual value (backup + portfolio) they didn't know existed
  - **Evidence**: Explicit callout: "AI taught you that backup and portfolio are dual values"
  - **Validation**: ✅ Student learns something they didn't ask about
- **Status**: ✅ PRESENT

#### Role 2: AI as Student (Student as Teacher) ✓

- **Requirement**: AI adapts to student's feedback/constraints
- **Location**: "Role 2: AI as Student — You Teach AI Your Constraints" (Part 2)
- **Implementation**:
  - Student corrects: "Don't push secrets—I have API config.json"
  - AI learns constraint: "Security is critical; protect secrets first"
  - AI adapts: "Create .gitignore, add config.json, commit before pushing"
  - **What AI learns**: Student's security constraint (secrets must stay local)
  - **Evidence**: Explicit callout: "AI adapted its approach from naive 'push everything' to 'protect secrets first'"
  - **Validation**: ✅ AI adapts based on student's correction
- **Status**: ✅ PRESENT

#### Role 3: AI as Co-Worker (Convergence) ✓

- **Requirement**: Iteration toward better solution; neither alone would achieve it
- **Location**: "Role 3: AI as Co-Worker — Convergence Through Recovery Testing" (Scenario section)
- **Implementation**:
  - Iteration 1: Student asks to verify backup with recovery test
  - Iteration 2: Student suggests testing in isolation to avoid affecting original
  - Iteration 3: AI refines approach: "Clone to temp folder, test, delete test clone"
  - **Convergence result**: Safe recovery verification neither initially planned
  - **Evidence**: Explicit callout: "Together, you've designed a safe recovery verification process"
  - **Implementation**: Activity 3.5 provides step-by-step recovery test
  - **Validation**: ✅ Convergence through iteration visible

#### Explicit "What You Learned / What AI Learned" Callouts ✓

- **Role 1**: "What You Learned: AI taught you that backup and portfolio are dual values"
- **Role 2**: "What AI Learned: Your security constraint (secrets must stay local)"
- **Role 3**: "Your Convergence: Together you've designed safe recovery verification"
- **Status**: ✅ ALL CALLOUTS PRESENT

#### Three Roles Validation Tag ✓

- **YAML Frontmatter**:
  ```
  three_roles_validation: "✓ AI teaches backup+portfolio dual value (Role 1), Student teaches
  constraints (Role 2), Convergence through recovery testing (Role 3)"
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ DOCUMENTED

#### Detection of One-Way Instruction (Fail Condition) ✓

- **Lesson does NOT present**: "Human → AI → Code → Done" (one-way instruction)
- **Lesson DOES present**: Bidirectional learning with iteration
- **Status**: ✅ APPROVED (not one-way)

## XII. File Path Verification

**File Created**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/reason-fm/apps/learn-app/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/08-git-and-github/04-cloud-backup-portfolio.md`

**Directory Structure**:

```

## XIII. Constitutional Reasoning Activation Check

**Question**: Did content-implementer reason through frameworks, or sample generic tutorial patterns?

**Evidence of Reasoning**:

1. ✅ Identified Stage 2 (AI Collaboration) and applied Three Roles framework explicitly
2. ✅ Counted cognitive load (4 concepts) against CEFR tier limits (A1: 5-7)
3. ✅ Verified anti-convergence: teaching modality varies from L1-3 and Chapter 7
4. ✅ Applied Hands-on Discovery modality (Execute → Observe → Understand → Apply)
5. ✅ Created convergence scenario (Role 3) showing iteration, not "perfect first try"
6. ✅ Mapped every activity to specific success criteria and functional requirements
7. ✅ Included explicit "What You Learned / What AI Learned" callouts (not just implicit)
8. ✅ Tested all Git commands with actual terminal logs (not hallucinated)
9. ✅ Integrated security teaching (.gitignore, secrets) without overload
10. ✅ Created optional recovery testing (Activity 3.5) to validate backup strategy

**Generic Pattern Avoidance**:

- ❌ NOT lecture-style explanation
- ❌ NOT one-way tool instruction
- ❌ NOT perfect-first-try solution
- ❌ NOT generic GitHub tutorial (includes AI collaboration focus)
- ❌ NOT all-concepts-in-one-lesson (4 concepts, carefully scoped)

**Status**: ✅ REASONING-ACTIVATED IMPLEMENTATION CONFIRMED (not generic sampling)

## XVIII. Deviation from Generic Patterns

### Anti-Convergence Validation

**Generic GitHub Tutorial Pattern** (what we AVOIDED):

```
"Here's how to use GitHub:
1. Create account
2. Create repo
3. Push code
4. Done."
```

**Our Implementation** (what we CREATED):

```
1. Manual foundation (understand GitHub first)
2. AI teaching moment (backup + portfolio dual value)
3. Student teaching moment (security constraint)
4. Iteration moment (safe recovery testing)
5. Verification moment (actually test recovery)
6. Reflection moment (articulate what you learned from AI)
```

**Differentiators**:

- ✅ Three Roles explicitly demonstrated (not assumed)
- ✅ Security teaching (secrets + .gitignore)
- ✅ Recovery testing (validates backup actually works)
- ✅ Convergence iteration (safe isolation approach)
- ✅ Portfolio framing (career value, not just technical)

**Status**: ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATES FROM GENERIC PATTERNS
