## Key Deliverables Summary

### Lesson 5 Content Highlights

#### Opening Hook

```markdown
In this lesson, you'll master the professional GitHub workflow where code is
reviewed BEFORE merging to main. You'll also learn the critical practice of
documenting AI assistance transparently—essential in AI-native development
where all work includes some AI contribution.

**Why This Matters**: Pull requests (PRs) are how teams review code before it ships.
In your case, they're also how you document and validate AI-generated code.
```

#### Core Concepts (4 Total, Within A2 Limit)

**Concept 1: Pull Request Creation**

- What PRs do and why they matter
- PR anatomy (base branch, compare branch, diff)
- How PRs provide safety check for AI code

**Concept 2: PR Description with AI Transparency** ⭐ CRITICAL

```markdown
## AI Assistance

**AI Tool Used**: [ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini]

**What AI Generated**:

- [Specific list of AI contributions]

**What I Modified**:

- [List of student modifications with reasons]
```

**Concept 3: Reviewing PR Diff**

- Diff visualization (red/green)
- 4-point safety checklist
- Example diff with annotations

**Concept 4: Merge Workflow**

- GitHub merge button
- Conflict resolution awareness
- Verification after merge

#### Three Roles Framework (Stage 2 Mandatory)

**Role 1: AI as Teacher** ✅

```markdown
You create basic PR description (minimal)
↓
AI suggests: "Include specific what you generated/modified sections"
↓
What You Learned: Transparency includes specifics, not just "used AI"
```

**Role 2: AI as Student** ✅

```markdown
AI writes technical description (jargon-heavy)
↓
Student corrects: "Make it plain language for non-programmers"
↓
What AI Learned: PR reviewed by non-technical stakeholders needs clarity
```

**Role 3: AI as Co-Worker (Convergence)** ✅

```markdown
Iteration 1: Basic PR structure
Iteration 2: Student adds testing feedback
Iteration 3: AI suggests documentation approach
Iteration 4: Neither alone would reach this quality—convergence achieved
```

#### Hands-On Activities (4 Total)

**Activity 1: Create Feature Branch**

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/add-multiplication
# Make changes to file
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add multiplication function"
git push -u origin feature/add-multiplication
```

**Activity 2: Create Pull Request on GitHub**

- Click "Compare & pull request" button
- Fill PR form with title, description, AI assistance section
- Create PR

**Activity 3: Review PR Diff**

- Click "Files Changed" tab
- Verify changes match intent
- Look for bugs or missing edge cases
- Review description completeness

**Activity 4: Merge Pull Request**

- Click "Merge pull request" button
- Confirm merge
- Verify main branch updated: `git checkout main && git pull`

#### Realistic AI Transparency Example

Complete PR with AI-generated code:

```markdown
## Summary

Added error handling to calculator to prevent crashes on invalid input.

## AI Assistance

**AI Tool Used**: ChatGPT

**What AI Generated**:

- Try/except blocks for all arithmetic functions
- validate_input() function with regex
- Error message templates

**What I Modified & Why**:

1. Error Messages: Made simpler (users need plain language, not technical jargon)
2. Edge Cases: Found bug where AI didn't handle empty input—fixed manually
3. Logging: Added debug output for visibility

## Testing Done

- Valid inputs: 5+3, 10-2, 4\*3, 20/4 ✓ All work
- Edge cases:
  - Empty input: Shows "Input required" ✓
  - Text input: Shows "Please enter a number" ✓
  - Division by zero: Shows error ✓
  - Very large numbers: Works ✓
  - Negative numbers: Works ✓
```
