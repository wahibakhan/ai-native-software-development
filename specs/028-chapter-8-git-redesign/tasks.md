# Tasks: Chapter 8 Redesign - Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/028-chapter-8-git-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (7-lesson structure), spec.md (4 user scenarios with priorities)

**Organization**: Tasks organized by lesson implementation (matching user scenario priorities)

**Policy Note**: Within this chapter, each lesson must end with a single final section titled "Try With AI" (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next"). Since this is Part 2, instruct learners to use ChatGPT web (AI tools not yet taught).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Lesson/Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (L1-L7)
- **[Story]**: Maps to user scenario from spec (US1-US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All lessons in: `apps/learn-app/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/08-git-and-github/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Content Redesign Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare for 7-lesson restructure and research requirements

- [ ] T001 Read existing 9 lessons in `apps/learn-app/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/08-git-and-github/` to identify reusable content
- [ ] T002 [P] Research GitHub Agent HQ features from official GitHub Blog (https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/)
- [ ] T003 [P] Test all Git commands in sandbox environment (init, status, add, commit, diff, restore, reset, branch, checkout, switch, merge, remote, push, pull, clone)
- [ ] T004 [P] Capture terminal logs for each Git command test (for lesson inclusion per C-014 constraint)
- [ ] T005 Create backup of existing 9-lesson chapter to `specs/028-chapter-8-git-redesign/original-lessons-backup/`

- T002 (Agent HQ research), T003 (Git testing), T004 (terminal logs), T006 (skill template) can all run in parallel

**Across Lessons (with sufficient writers)**:

- After L1 complete: L2 implementation can start
- After L2 complete: L3 can start
- After L3 complete: L4 can start
- After L4 complete: L5 can start
- After L5 complete: L6 can start
- After L6 complete: L7 can start

**Within Validation Phase**:

- All T106-T113 (content checks) can run in parallel
- All T114-T120 (constitutional checks) can run in parallel
- All T121-T124 (coverage checks) can run in parallel
- All T125-T129 (success criteria checks) can run in parallel

**Within Polish Phase**:

- All T130-T137 can run in parallel (different files/concerns)

## Parallel Example: Phase 1 Setup

```bash
# Launch all research/testing tasks together:
Task T002: "Research GitHub Agent HQ from official GitHub Blog"
Task T003: "Test all Git commands in sandbox environment"
Task T004: "Capture terminal logs for each Git command"
Task T006: "Generate git-workflow.md skill template"

# These tasks access different resources (web, terminal, files) with no conflicts
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Foundation Lessons)

1. **Phase 1**: Complete Setup (T001-T006)
   - Research done, Git commands validated, existing content audited
2. **Phase 2**: Complete L1 (T007-T018)
   - Manual Git foundation established
3. **Phase 3**: Complete L2 (T019-T029)
   - Error recovery confidence built
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test L1-L2 with pilot students
5. Deploy L1-L2 if validation passes (early access to foundation)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Deploy L1-L2 → Foundation lessons (students can start)
2. Add L3 → Branch experimentation (tested independently)
3. Add L4 → GitHub backup (tested independently)
4. Add L5 → Professional PRs (tested independently)
5. Add L6 → Reusable intelligence (tested independently)
6. Add L7 → Capstone + Agent HQ (complete chapter)
7. Each lesson adds value without breaking previous lessons

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple content writers:

1. **Week 1**: All writers complete Phase 1 together (shared research/testing)
2. **Week 2**:
   - Writer A: L1 + L2 (foundation pair)
   - Writer B: L3 + L4 (application pair)
   - Writer C: L5 + L6 (integration pair)
3. **Week 3**:
   - Writer A: L7 (capstone requires all context)
   - Writers B+C: Validation (Phase 9)
4. **Week 4**: All writers: Polish (Phase 10)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files/resources, no dependencies
- **[Lesson] label**: Maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to user scenario from spec.md
- Each lesson should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each lesson or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate lesson independently
- **No automated tests required**: This is educational content, not software. Validation is pedagogical (T106-T129), not unit/integration tests
- **"Try With AI" mandate**: Every lesson ends with this section (not "Key Takeaways"), using ChatGPT web since AI tools not yet taught in Part 2
- **Hands-on discovery**: Execute → Observe → Understand → AI-enhance pattern throughout (not lecture-style)
- **Three Roles required in L3-L5**: AI as Teacher, Student as Teacher, Co-Worker convergence must be demonstrated
- **Constitutional compliance**: All 7 principles validated in Phase 9 (T114-T120)

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 137 tasks

- Phase 1 (Setup): 6 tasks
- Phase 2 (L1): 12 tasks
- Phase 3 (L2): 11 tasks
- Phase 4 (L3): 14 tasks
- Phase 5 (L4): 14 tasks
- Phase 6 (L5): 13 tasks
- Phase 7 (L6): 11 tasks
- Phase 8 (L7): 24 tasks (10 synthesis + 6 Agent HQ + 8 finalization)
- Phase 9 (Validation): 24 tasks
- Phase 10 (Polish): 8 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**User Scenario Coverage**:

- US1 (Safe AI Experimentation): L1, L2, L3, L7 (49 tasks)
- US2 (GitHub Backup & Portfolio): L4, L5, L7 (32 tasks)
- US3 (Branch Testing): L3, L7 (22 tasks)
- US4 (Agent HQ Awareness): L7 Part B (7 tasks)

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + L1 + L2 (29 tasks) = Foundation lessons with manual Git mastery

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- L1: Student creates repo, stages, commits, views history manually ✓
- L2: Student views diffs, undos changes at all 3 levels ✓
- L3: Student creates branches, tests parallel implementations, merges ✓
- L4: Student connects GitHub, pushes, clones from different machine ✓
- L5: Student creates PR with AI transparency, merges ✓
- L6: Student documents git-workflow.md, applies to new project ✓
- L7: Student manages complete workflow for AI-generated project ✓

**Format Validation**: ✅ All 137 tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Lesson/Story] Description with file path`
