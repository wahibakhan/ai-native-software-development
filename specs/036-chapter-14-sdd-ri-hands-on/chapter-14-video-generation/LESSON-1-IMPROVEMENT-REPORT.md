## Improvement Summary

Successfully refactored Lesson 01 to align with **Chapter 14's video generation project context** while preserving core pedagogical concepts (Horizontal/Vertical Intelligence, P+Q+P framework).

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Context Shift: Calculator → Video Generation

**Old Context**:

- Calculator project (generic programming example)
- Calculator-specific ADR example: "Used JWT for authentication"
- Calculator-specific PHR example: "Write a calculator" prompt

**New Context**:

- Product demo video generation (SaaS marketing use case)
- Video-specific ADR example: "Chose Playwright MCP over Selenium because Gemini.google.com requires real browser context with session persistence"
- Video-specific PHR example: Detailed product demo video prompts with marketing messaging

**Changed Sections**:

- Section: "ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)" — New Playwright MCP + Gemini integration example
- Section: "PHRs (Prompt History Records)" — New video generation prompts with marketing effectiveness
- Section: "Example: Video Generation Specification Subagent" — Renamed from calculator, new persona/questions/principles
- Horizontal Intelligence compounding example — Changed from generic "Project 1-10" to "Project 1 (Video Generation) → Project 2 (Auth System)"
- Delegation Pattern diagram — Changed from "Build a calculator" to "Build a system that generates product demo videos and uploads to YouTube"

### 2. Added Business Context & Motivation

**New Section**: "Why This Matters for Video Generation"

- Articulates business problem: "SaaS companies spend $5,000-$50,000 per professional demo video"
- Shows portfolio value of the chapter project
- Connects learning to real-world deliverables

**Integrated into Intro**:

- Changed opening: "Before you start building AI-generated product demo videos, understand..."
- Added YouTube/Gemini context to framework description

### 3. Updated Frontmatter & Metadata

**Changed**:

- Removed chapter/lesson inconsistencies (was chapter: 31, now: 14)
- Updated proficiency level: A2 (confirmed for chapter tier)
- Changed source_spec path to `specs/chapter-14-video-generation/spec.md`
- Updated cognitive load assessment with A2 context
- Modified differentiation examples to reference video production domain
- Updated version to 2.0.0
- Updated git_author, created/last_modified dates

### 4. Verified Constitutional Compliance

**Checks Passed**:

- ✅ No calculator references remain (0 matches)
- ✅ Video generation context present (42 references)
- ✅ NO forbidden end sections (no "What's Next", "Key Takeaways", "Summary")
- ✅ Lesson ends with "Try With AI" section ONLY
- ✅ NO meta-commentary ("AI as Teacher", "What to notice", framework labels)
- ✅ NO explicit pedagogical scaffolding exposed
- ✅ H/V Intelligence concepts intact and clear
- ✅ Cognitive load: 2 new concepts (within A2 limit of 7)

### 5. Updated "Try With AI" Prompts

**Changed**:

- All four AI exploration prompts now use video generation context
- Added specific technical details (Playwright MCP, Gemini.google.com, YouTube)
- Added marketing-specific considerations (SaaS context, video messaging, call-to-action validation)
- Preserved open-ended exploration structure (4 prompts: Explore, Practice, Calculate, Apply)

## Content Mapping

### Maintained Sections

- "What Is Spec-Kit Plus?" (framework definition + diagrams)
- "Horizontal Intelligence: Capturing Reasoning Across Time"
- "Vertical Intelligence: Delegation Through Specialization"
- P+Q+P framework explanation
- Reusability principles

### Refactored Sections

- ADR example: Calculator → Playwright MCP + Gemini
- PHR example: Generic calculator prompt → Specific video marketing prompt
- Specification Subagent: Generic → Video Production Specialist
- Delegation Pattern: Build calculator → Build video generation system
- Compounding effect: Generic Project 1-10 → Project 1 (Video) → Project 2 (Auth)

### New Sections

- "Why This Matters for Video Generation" (business context + value proposition)

---

## Learning Objectives Alignment

**Lesson Objectives** (from frontmatter):

1. Explain how Spec-Kit Plus captures Reusable Intelligence through ADRs, PHRs, and Subagents

   - ✅ ADRs section: Playwright MCP architectural reasoning
   - ✅ PHRs section: Video prompt effectiveness logging
   - ✅ Subagent section: Video Production Specialist P+Q+P pattern

2. Recognize the compounding effect of intelligence accumulation across projects
   - ✅ "Compounding effect" subsection: Project 1-10 intelligence accumulation
   - ✅ "Try With AI" prompt: Calculate intelligence compounding across Project 1-4

---

## Cognitive Load Assessment

**New Concepts**: 2

- Horizontal Intelligence (ADRs, PHRs)
- Vertical Intelligence (Subagents, P+Q+P)

**Assessment**: ✅ Within A2 limit (≤7 concepts)

**Scaffolding Level**: Moderate (A2-appropriate)

- Clear explanations with concrete examples
- Video domain context familiar to SaaS users
- Progressive disclosure (WHY → WHAT → HOW)

---

## Pedagogical Design Notes

### Layer Recognition

- **Layer**: L1 (Conceptual Foundation)
- **Approach**: Direct explanation with concrete examples, no AI yet
- **Why**: Students need mental model of Spec-Kit Plus architecture before using it

### Three Roles Status

- **Framework Visibility**: INVISIBLE to students
- **Content Type**: Conceptual (explains framework, not experiential)
- **Appropriate**: Yes (conceptual chapters don't require Three Roles demonstrations)

### Intelligence Types

- **Horizontal**: Emphasized through ADRs + PHRs with video-specific examples
- **Vertical**: Emphasized through P+Q+P pattern and subagent specialization
- **Connection**: Both contribute to "intelligence accumulation" theme
