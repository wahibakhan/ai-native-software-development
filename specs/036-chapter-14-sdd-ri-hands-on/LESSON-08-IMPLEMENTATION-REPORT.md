## Content Sections (10 Total)

### 1. Opening Paragraph (Lines 81-85)

**Purpose**: Frame the lesson as moving from theory to execution
**Content**: Sets expectation for control + validation focus
**Layer**: Layer 2 (AI Collaboration) context established

### 2. What Happens During Implementation (Lines 89-119)

**Purpose**: Overview of 4 phases with 12 tasks
**Structure**: Tree diagram showing all phases and checkpoints
**Alignment**: Maps directly to L07 task breakdown
**Key**: Shows where human checkpoints occur (4 total)

### 3. Running /sp.implement (Lines 123-142)

**Purpose**: How to actually invoke the command
**Content**: Exact command structure with file paths
**Specification**: References specs/013-chapter-14-redesign/
**Agent behavior**: Lists 4 steps agent takes (read → execute → show → wait)

### 4. Checkpoint Review Pattern (Lines 146-172)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate checkpoint 1 with practical checklist
**Example output**: What agent reports after Phase 1
**Your checklist**: 4 concrete review items (file check, directory, network access, errors)
**Decisions**: Show both approval and rejection paths
**Control emphasis**: "You direct the next phase" (not autonomous)

### 5. The Iteration Loop: When Things Fail (Lines 176-200)

**Purpose**: Show three roles invisibly (Teaching/Learning/Co-working)
**Contrast**: Side-by-side comparison without vs with checkpoints
**Scenario**: Real failure (Gemini timeout) with recovery
**Key insight**: Early detection prevents blind retries
**AI role**: Agent adapts to human feedback (AI as Student)

### 6. Phase 3 Details (Lines 204-232)

**Purpose**: Show Playwright MCP browser automation in action
**Content**: What agent does (session reuse, input, wait, download)
**Terminal output**: Realistic log showing actual commands + confirmations
**Payoff moment**: "A video file exists on your machine"
**Three Roles hidden**: Agent is Teacher (shows how session persistence works)

### 7. Validation Phase (Lines 236-273)

**Purpose**: Prove video meets specification through validation
**ffprobe command**: Exact bash command for verification
**Expected output**: Codec, resolution, duration values
**What to check**: 4 properties against spec (codec, resolution, duration, size)
**Playback validation**: 7-item checklist (dashboard, button, form, animation, confetti, text, audio)

### 8. What You Get After Completion (Lines 277-301)

**Purpose**: Show visible + invisible artifacts
**Visible**: `./output/demo-video.mp4` with properties
**Invisible**: PHR files auto-captured during implementation
**Forward integration**: References L09 (creating reusable skills from PHRs)
**Knowledge capture**: Explains why PHRs matter for intelligence accumulation

### 9. Common Implementation Mistakes (Lines 305-335)

**Mistake 1**: Skipping checkpoint review (hidden issues surface late)
**Mistake 2**: Accepting video without validation (could be truncated/wrong codec)
**Mistake 3**: Not iterating when first attempt fails (timeouts are often transient)
**Each**: Error → Why it's wrong → The fix (3 parts per mistake)

### 10. Try With AI (Lines 339-354)

**Format**: 4 exploration prompts (no summary, key takeaways, or what's next)
**Prompt 1**: Checkpoint review practice (specific checklist per phase)
**Prompt 2**: Validation command practice (ffprobe + interpretation)
**Prompt 3**: Failure recovery scenarios (4 concrete problems + solutions)
**Prompt 4**: Reflection on outcome (tangible artifact proof)
**Closing**: Ends file properly (no additional sections)

## Constitutional Compliance Analysis

### Three Roles Framework (Layer 2 Invisible Implementation)

**AI as Teacher** ✓

- **Where shown**: Checkpoint dialogue (lines 150-156) shows agent explaining outputs
- **Example**: "Playwright MCP verified...", "Session storage directory created..."
- **Student learns**: How Playwright MCP configuration works, session persistence behavior
- **Framework hidden**: No labels like "This is AI teaching you"
- **Natural presentation**: Agent is simply reporting what it accomplished

**AI as Student** ✓

- **Where shown**: Iteration loop (lines 188-197) shows agent adapting to human feedback
- **Example**: "Gemini timed out. Let me check manually... Network issue on our end. Let's retry Task 3.3."
- **Student learns**: How AI responds to human constraints and feedback
- **Framework hidden**: No meta-commentary about "AI learning from you"
- **Natural presentation**: Collaborative problem-solving with visible back-and-forth

**AI as Co-Worker** ✓

- **Where shown**: Phase 3 terminal output (lines 214-229) shows partnership in action
- **Example**: Sequential task execution with human oversight at checkpoints
- **Student learns**: How to work with AI on complex projects (not micromanaging, not hands-off)

### Proficiency Alignment (B1)

**Cognitive Load Analysis** ✓

```
Concepts counted:
1. /sp.implement orchestration (how command works)
2. Checkpoint review pattern (when + how to review)
3. Playwright MCP validation (session persistence, browser automation)
4. Video codec/resolution/duration validation (ffprobe interpretation)
5. Iteration loop pattern (failure detection + recovery)
6. Session persistence mechanism (cookies, reuse)
7. Quality gates (multiple validation criteria)
8. Artifact preservation (files + PHRs)

Total: 8 concepts (within B1 limit of 10) ✓
```

**Scaffolding Level** ✓

- **Type**: Moderate (high-level guidance, student finds approach)
- **Example**: "Review this checklist, then decide approve/reject" (not step-by-step)
- **Example**: "Work with AI to diagnose" timeout (not detailed recovery steps)
- **Appropriate for B1**: Independent developers who can problem-solve with guidance

**Bloom's Cognitive Level** ✓

- **Apply**: Execute /sp.implement, run ffprobe, apply checkpoint pattern
- **Evaluate**: Review outputs, validate against spec, judge quality gates
- **NOT Analyze/Create**: Those are for C2, not B1
- **Appropriate for B1**: Executing established patterns, not designing new ones

### Evals-First Alignment

**Learning Objectives Mapped to Content** ✓

```
Objective 1: Execute /sp.implement to orchestrate 12 atomic tasks
  → Sections: "Running /sp.implement" + "What Happens During Implementation"
  → Assessment: Successful implementation with visible checkpoints

Objective 2: Validate AI-generated video against specification
  → Sections: "Validation Phase" + "What You Get After Completion"
  → Assessment: ffprobe verification + playback checklist

Objective 3: Apply checkpoint pattern to maintain control
  → Sections: "Checkpoint Review Pattern" + "The Iteration Loop"
  → Assessment: Evidence of review at each phase boundary

Objective 4: Debug failures and iterate
  → Sections: "The Iteration Loop" + "Common Implementation Mistakes"
  → Assessment: Successfully resolve issues and re-execute
```

**No Tangential Content** ✓

- Every section maps to at least one learning objective
- No "interesting but irrelevant" historical content
- No extended examples unrelated to core learning
- No bloat sections that don't support objectives

### Differentiation Provisions

**For Advanced Learners** ✓

- Analyze PHRs captured during implementation
- Understand intelligence accumulation (PHRs → future skills)
- Modify video prompt for different product types
- Extend validation with additional video analysis tools

**For Struggling Learners** ✓

- Focus on Phase 1-2 (Setup/Session) before video generation
- Validate with simplified criteria (file exists, basic ffprobe)
- Complete Phase 3-4 only after Phase 1-2 proven
- Use "Try With AI" Prompt 3 for failure recovery practice

## Key Strengths

1. **Checkpoint Pattern Made Concrete**: Not just described, but shown with realistic example and review checklist
2. **Iteration Loop Visibility**: Real failure scenario (timeout) with recovery path emphasizes human judgment value
3. **Three Roles Hidden but Present**: Agent teaching (checkpoint outputs), agent learning (adaptation to feedback), agents co-working (collaborative workflow)
4. **Terminal Output Realistic**: ffprobe command + expected values help students validate their own work
5. **Tangible Outcome Emphasized**: Video file as proof that SDD-RI works (not abstract theory)
6. **PHR Forward Integration**: Explains why invisible artifacts matter for L09 (skill creation)
