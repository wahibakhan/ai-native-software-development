## KEY INSIGHT DELIVERED

This lesson implements the critical principle: **"Tasks aren't just checkboxes — they're executable instructions including the creative brief for AI generation."**

The video generation prompt is not an abstract concept but a **concrete deliverable** produced in Task 3.1, ready to copy-paste into Gemini for actual video generation.

## Content Structure

### 1. Opening Hook (Checkpoint Pattern Foundation)

- Contrasts WITH vs WITHOUT checkpoints
- Establishes human control as core principle
- Shows why checkpoints prevent cascading failures

### 2. What Are Tasks? (Atomicity Definition)

- **Size**: 15-30 minutes (not hours, not minutes)
- **Criterion**: Single, testable acceptance criterion
- **Independence**: Can be reviewed individually
- **Clarity**: Defines exact completion signal

### 3. The Checkpoint Pattern (CRITICAL Section)

- Pattern definition: Agent → Review → Decide → Direct
- Why checkpoints matter (control + early failure detection)
- Your role at each checkpoint (review, decide, direct)

### 4. Task Structure for Video Generation (4 Phases, 12 Tasks)

#### Phase 1: Setup & Verification (3 tasks, 30-45 min)

- Task 1.1: Verify Playwright MCP Configuration
- Task 1.2: Create Session Storage Directory
- Task 1.3: Verify Gemini.google.com Accessibility

#### Phase 2: Browser Session Setup (2 tasks, 30-45 min)

- Task 2.1: Execute First-Run Login Workflow
- Task 2.2: Verify Session Persistence

#### Phase 3: Video Generation (4 tasks, 60-90 min)

- Task 3.1: **Structure and Finalize Video Generation Prompt** [DELIVERS PROMPT]
- Task 3.2: Login with Persisted Session and Navigate
- Task 3.3: Submit Video Generation Prompt to Gemini
- Task 3.4: Wait for Generation and Download Video

#### Phase 4: Validation & Finalization (3 tasks, 45-60 min)

- Task 4.1: Move Video to Project Directory
- Task 4.2: Verify Video File Format and Properties
- Task 4.3: Test Video Playback and Validate Content

### 5. The VIDEO PROMPT (Task 3.1 Deliverable)

**Complete, production-ready prompt for Gemini.google.com video generation:**

```
Create a 45-second product demo video showing:

Scene 1 (0-10s): Modern SaaS dashboard with clean UI
- Show dashboard interface with charts, metrics, user list
- Fade in smoothly from black
- Keep animations minimal, business-focused

Scene 2 (10-20s): User clicks "Sign Up" button
- Button highlight, form appears with smooth slide-in
- Shows email field, password field, name field
- Form is modern, minimal, professional design

Scene 3 (20-35s): Form filling animation
- Auto-fill animation for each field (very smooth, 0.5s per field)
- Fields light up as they complete
- Smooth transitions between fields, no jarring movements

Scene 4 (35-45s): Success confirmation
- Confetti animation (subtle, professional, not cartoonish)
- "Account created!" message fades in
- Text overlay: "Sign up in under 60 seconds" appears
- Fade to black

Overall Style:
- Professional corporate aesthetic (SaaS marketing standard)
- Minimal design language (Apple-like, not cluttered)
- Smooth transitions (nothing abrupt, 3+ second minimum per scene)
- Color palette: Modern blues, grays, whites (tech company standard)

Video Specifications:
- Format: MP4 with H.264 codec
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (standard for marketing)
- Duration: 45-50 seconds (strict)
- Frame rate: 30fps (standard for web)
- Audio: Subtle upbeat corporate background music (no voiceover)

Important:
- NO spoken narration (music only)
- NO distracting animations or emoji
- NO flashy effects (this is B2B marketing, not entertainment)
- Content must match prompt exactly (validate before delivery)
```

**Why This Prompt Works:**

- Scene-by-scene structure with explicit timing constraints
- Clear style keywords Gemini understands (SaaS, minimal, professional)
- Explicit constraints preventing misinterpretation (no narration, no cartoonish)
- Technical specifications (codec, resolution, frame rate) for quality assurance
- Acceptance criteria embedded (validate content matches prompt exactly)

### 6. Checkpoint Sequence (Workflow Control)

- Checkpoint 1: After Phase 1 (Setup verification)
- Checkpoint 2: After Phase 2 (Session persistence)
- Checkpoint 3: After Phase 3 (Video generated and downloaded)
- Checkpoint 4: After Phase 4 (Validation complete, project done)

Each checkpoint shows:

- Agent report of phase completion
- What to review
- Human decision gate
- Next action

### 7. Task Dependency Graph (Visual)

- Clear ASCII diagram showing task sequencing
- Phase-by-phase organization
- Checkpoint gates marked visually
- Linear progression (each task depends on previous)

### 8. Lineage Traceability Example

Shows how to trace requirement from spec → plan → task:

```
Specification: "Generate video demonstrating product demo workflow"
  ↓
Plan: "Phase 3: Video Generation - Submit refined prompt..."
  ↓
Task 3.1: "Structure and Finalize Video Generation Prompt"
  ↓
Acceptance: "Prompt has 4+ explicit scenes with start/end times..."
```

### 9. Common Mistakes (3 Critical)

1. **Tasks Too Large** (45+ minutes) → breaks atomicity, delays feedback
2. **Combining Manual and Automated** → confuses failure points
3. **Vague Acceptance Criteria** → can't tell if task is done

Each mistake includes fix with concrete examples.

### 10. Try With AI (4 Exploration Prompts)

- **Explore Task Atomicity**: Validate each task does ONE thing
- **Practice Checkpoint Validation**: Create checklist for each checkpoint
- **Analyze Dependencies**: Test critical path and failure recovery
- **Test Prompt Quality**: Evaluate video prompt for ambiguities

## Constitutional Compliance

### Framework Invisibility ✓

- Zero explicit pedagogical labels
- No "AI as Teacher", "What you learned", "Role" terminology
- Framework stays invisible (students EXPERIENCE, not STUDY)

### Ending Structure ✓

- Lesson ends with "## Try With AI" section only
- No Key Takeaways, Summary, What's Next, Safety Notes
- Exploration prompts as final engagement

### Evidence Requirement ✓

- All acceptance criteria are testable
- Tasks include concrete outputs (files, directories, confirmed state)
- Validation section (Phase 4) shows HOW to verify completion

### Task Atomicity ✓

- All 12 tasks are 15-30 minutes (within proficiency limit)
- Each has single, clear acceptance criterion
- Sized for human review and verification

### Three Roles Framework ✓

- While not explicitly labeled, checkpoint pattern shows:
  - **AI as Teacher**: Agent completes phase, suggests next step
  - **AI as Student**: Agent waits for human review before continuing
  - **AI as Co-Worker**: Human decision at each checkpoint directs next phase

## Learning Objectives (Met)

1. ✓ Use /sp.tasks to decompose video generation plan into atomic work units
2. ✓ Understand checkpoint pattern for video generation (Setup → Session → Generation → Validation)
3. ✓ Create production-ready video generation prompt with scene-by-scene structure and timing
4. ✓ Trace requirement lineage from specification through plan to tasks

---

## Differentiation

### For Advanced Students

- Design video prompts for 2-3 different product types (SaaS, mobile app, API)
- Analyze how prompt structure changes by domain
- Identify which constraints matter most for each domain

### For Struggling Students

- Focus on Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 3 (Video Generation) tasks first
- Delay Phase 4 validation until initial video generation succeeds
- Use provided prompt as-is; explore variations after success

## Integration Points

### Upstream Dependency

- L06 (Research Phase) provides video research findings
- L07 converts research into structured prompt (Task 3.1)

### Downstream Dependency

- L08 (Implement Phase) executes these 12 tasks with checkpoints
- Skills layer: Tasks become training data for `generate-video` skill

### Chapter Progression

- Chapter 13: Theory (SDD-RI principles)
- Chapter 14: Practice (this chapter, hands-on workflow)
- L01-03: Foundation (spec, constitution, setup)
- L04-05: Specification and clarification
- L06: Research (find what works)
- **L07: Tasks breakdown (this lesson)** ← Bridges research to execution
- L08: Execution with checkpoints
- L09: Reusable skill creation

## Key Teaching Innovations

### 1. Tasks as Concrete Outputs

Not abstract "break work into tasks", but 12 specific, named, durations tasks with explicit outputs (files, confirmed states, validated content).

### 2. Prompt as Deliverable

Video generation prompt isn't explained—it's INCLUDED, ready for copy-paste execution. Students see concrete prompt writing skill.

### 3. Checkpoint Pattern Enforced

Four explicit checkpoint gates show human decision-making at critical moments. Not "checkpoints are good" (abstract) but "here's where YOU decide" (concrete).

### 4. Browser Automation Integration

Playwright MCP not as abstract "browser automation" but specific tasks (1.1: verify MCP, 2.1: login workflow, 3.2: reuse session). Students see practical browser automation.

### 5. Quality Gates Explicit

Phase 4 validation isn't assumed; it's specific (ffprobe codec check, duration validation, content review). Students learn what "quality" means operationally.

## Constitutional Adherence Summary

This lesson exemplifies Constitutional Principle 7 (Spec-Driven Development):

- Specification (Chapter 13, earlier lessons) is **source of truth**
- Plan (L06) translates spec to architecture
- **Tasks (this lesson)** break plan into atomic, executable units
- Implementation (L08) executes tasks with checkpoints
- Reusable Intelligence (L09) crystallizes patterns into skills

Each layer builds on previous layer's clarity. Vague spec → vague plan → unclear tasks. Clear spec → clear plan → precise tasks (like this lesson demonstrates).
