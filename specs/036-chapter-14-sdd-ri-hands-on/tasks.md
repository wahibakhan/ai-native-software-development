# Tasks: Chapter 14 — SDD-RI Hands-On with Spec-Kit Plus

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/036-chapter-14-sdd-ri-hands-on/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (user stories), plan.md (lesson structure with content strategy)
**Project Type**: Educational Content (Docusaurus lessons)
**Target Directory**: `apps/learn-app/docs/04-SDD-RI-Fundamentals/14-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/`

**Policy**: Within this chapter, each lesson must end with a single final section titled "Try With AI" (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next"). Students use their preferred AI companion tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- **No Story Label**: Setup/Foundational/Polish tasks

## Content Strategy Key

From plan.md alignment decision:

- **KEEP & IMPROVE**: Same structure, better examples (video domain)
- **KEEP & EXTEND**: Add new content (e.g., Playwright MCP setup)
- **KEEP & PIVOT**: Same pattern, new domain examples
- **RECREATE**: New content replacing calculator with video/YouTube
- **NEW**: Entirely new lesson

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Foundation L01-L03)
    ↓
Phase 3 (US1: Workflow L04-L08) ← Linear (each lesson builds on previous)
    ↓
Phase 4 (US2: Intelligence L09) ← Requires L08 completion
    ↓
Phase 5 (Brownfield L10) ← Can run parallel with Phase 6
    ↓
Phase 6 (US3: Capstone L11) ← Requires L09 skills
    ↓
Phase 7 (Quiz & Validation)
    ↓
Phase 8 (Polish)
```

### Lesson Dependencies

```
L01 → L02 → L03 (Foundation: sequential)
L03 → L04 → L05 → L06 → L07 → L08 (US1 Workflow: linear)
L08 → L09 (Pattern recognition requires workflow execution)
L09 → L11 (Capstone requires skills)
L10 (Brownfield): Standalone after L03
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 2** (after T004):

- T005-T007 (L01) can run parallel with T008-T010 (L02)

**Within Phase 3**:

- T014 (L04 content) can run parallel with T021 (L06 content) — different files
- T025 (L07 content) can run parallel with T029 (L08 content) — different files

**Phase 5 + Phase 6**:

- L10 (Brownfield) can run parallel with L11 (Capstone) — independent content

**Within Phase 7**:

- T045-T046 (Quiz) can run parallel with T047-T050 (Validation)
