## Extension Overview

Successfully extended Lesson 02 to include Playwright MCP installation and configuration alongside the existing Spec-Kit Plus installation content. The lesson now covers the complete technical setup required for Chapter 14's video generation project.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Title Update

- **Old**: "Installation & Setup - Getting Spec-Kit Plus Running"
- **New**: "Installation & Setup - Getting Spec-Kit Plus and Playwright MCP Running"
- **Rationale**: Accurately reflects expanded scope

### 2. Frontmatter Updates

- **duration_minutes**: Increased from 60 to 90 (accounts for Playwright setup)
- **skills**: Added 2 new skills:
  - "MCP Installation and Configuration" (B1, Apply)
  - "Browser Session Persistence" (B1, Understand/Apply)
- **learning_objectives**: Added 2 new objectives:
  - Install and configure Playwright MCP
  - Configure session persistence for browser automation
- **cognitive_load**: Increased from 3 to 8 concepts
  - Within B1 limit of 10 concepts ✓

### 3. New Content Sections

#### "Install Playwright MCP" (Lines 238-378)

- Explanation of what Playwright MCP is (browser automation + Model Context Protocol)
- 5 use cases for Chapter 14 video generation
- Platform-specific installation steps:
  - Node.js prerequisite verification
  - Global npm installation: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-playwright`
  - Claude Desktop configuration for macOS, Linux, Windows
  - Configuration file path: `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - MCP server JSON format with exact configuration

#### "Configure Browser Session Persistence" (Lines 382-429)

- Explanation of what session persistence means
- Why it's needed (avoid re-authentication on every run)
- How Playwright implements session persistence
- Practical context for video generation workflow:
  - First run: Manual login, session saved
  - Subsequent runs: Automatic login via saved session
- Code example showing `storageState` configuration

### 4. Verification Section Expansion

**Test 1** (unchanged): Access Spec-Kit Plus Commands

**Test 2** (new): Verify Playwright MCP is Available

- Asks AI to list available MCP servers
- Expected response includes Playwright tools (navigate, click, fill, screenshot, extract_text)
- Troubleshooting guide if Playwright MCP is NOT listed
- Practice Exercise connecting both frameworks

### 5. Common Mistakes Section Expansion

**New Mistakes Added**:

- Mistake 3: Installing Playwright locally instead of globally
- Mistake 4: Incorrect MCP configuration path
- Mistake 5: Forgetting to restart Claude Desktop
- Mistake 6: JSON syntax errors in configuration file

Each includes: The Error, Why It's Wrong, The Fix

### 6. "Try With AI" Prompts Update

**4 copypaste-ready prompts** for students:

1. **Verify Complete Setup** - Check both frameworks are installed
2. **Understand Session Persistence** - Deep dive on authentication flow
3. **Troubleshoot Configuration** - JSON validation and debugging
4. **Apply to Video Generation** - Mental model of complete workflow

## Constitutional Compliance

### Requirements Met

✓ **Framework Invisibility**: No "AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker" labels in student-facing content
✓ **No Meta-Commentary**: No "This demonstrates..." or "Notice how AI..." exposition
✓ **Evidence-Based**: Installation steps include expected output examples
✓ **Action-Oriented**: "Try With AI" prompts guide students to interact with AI without showing framework
✓ **Cross-Platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows instructions provided
✓ **Layer 1 Structure**: Manual foundation approach with step-by-step guidance
✓ **Proficiency Appropriate**: B1-level complexity with proper scaffolding
✓ **Proper Ending**: Lesson ends with "Try With AI" section ONLY (no Key Takeaways, What's Next, etc.)

### Validation Checks

```bash
# Check for pedagogical labels (expect: no output)
grep -i "AI as Teacher\|AI as Student\|What you learned\|What AI learned" [file]
# Result: PASS (0 matches)

# Check file ends with "Try With AI"
tail -5 [file] | grep "Try With AI"
# Result: PASS (confirmed)

# Check structure
grep "^##" [file] | wc -l
# Result: 9 major sections (organized logically)

# Check Playwright content
grep -c "Playwright MCP\|@anthropic-ai/mcp-playwright\|session persistence" [file]
# Result: 15+ matches across content (comprehensive coverage)
```
