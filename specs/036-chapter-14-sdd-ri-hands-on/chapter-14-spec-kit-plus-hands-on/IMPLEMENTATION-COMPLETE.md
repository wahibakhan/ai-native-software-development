## What Was Changed

### Content Strategy: KEEP STRUCTURE, NEW EXAMPLES

**Maintained**:

- Persona + Questions + Principles (P+Q+P) framework structure
- Skill vs subagent distinction (guidance vs autonomous)
- Step-by-step skill creation process
- Self-check validation pattern
- Reusability assessment framework

**Replaced**:

- Calculator pattern examples → Video generation patterns
- Calculator-specific math operations → Video generation with Gemini/Playwright MCP
- Generic skill examples → Domain-specific video production skill

**Added**:

- Pattern recognition from Lessons 04-08 workflow (specification writing, quality validation, Playwright automation)
- Complete `generate-video` skill template with:

  - Metadata (name, category, complexity, reuse context)
  - Persona (video production director with film director analogy)
  - Analytical Questions (5 categories: narrative, pacing, technical, alignment, engagement)
  - Decision Principles (5 frameworks: prompt structure, quality gates, iteration, pass/fail, automation)
  - Complete usage example (Python data analysis tool video demo)
  - 8 self-check validation points

- Preview of `upload-youtube` skill showing:

  - How P+Q+P pattern adapts to upload context
  - Persona shift from "director" to "editor"
  - Connection to Lesson 11 capstone

- Real-world intelligence acceleration progression:
  - Project 1: Execute full workflow (10 hours)
  - Project 2: Apply single skill (1 hour) = 10x faster
  - Project 3: Compose multiple skills (4 hours)

## Constitutional Compliance Summary

### Three Roles Framework: INVISIBLE

**Verified**:

```bash
grep -c "AI as\|What you learned:\|What AI learned:\|Role 1:\|Stage [0-9]" lesson.md
Result: 0 (zero matches)
```

- No "AI as Teacher", "AI as Student", "AI as Co-Worker" labels
- No "What you learned:" or "What AI learned:" meta-commentary
- No "Role 1:", "Role 2:", "Role 3:" pedagogical headers
- No "Stage [0-9]" or "Layer [0-9]" framework exposure
- Framework stays implicit in natural collaboration patterns

### Structure: Activity Ending Only

**Verified**:

```bash
Last ## heading: ## Try With AI
No sections after activity
File ends cleanly with prompts
```

- Last major section is "## Try With AI"
- Four copyable student prompts for AI collaboration
- No "Key Takeaways", "Summary", "What's Next", or meta-commentary after
- File structure:
  ```
  ## Skill Reuse in Practice
  ---
  ## Try With AI
  [4 prompts]
  ---
  [FILE ENDS]
  ```

## Try With AI: Four Copyable Prompts

### Prompt 1: Explore P+Q+P Pattern

```
Explain the Persona + Questions + Principles pattern for skill design.
For video generation, show me: (1) What Persona activates the right thinking?
(2) What 5-7 Analytical Questions force deep analysis?
(3) What 5 Decision Principles provide concrete rules?
```

### Prompt 2: Design the Persona

```
Help me create a Persona for video generation skill. I want it to establish
cognitive stance specific to video production. Guide me through:
(1) What analogy best captures video production thinking?
(2) What cognitive stance should it adopt?
(3) How does this differ from 'AI generation expert'?
(4) Write the complete Persona section.
```

### Prompt 3: Create Analytical Questions

```
Generate 5-7 Analytical Questions for my video generation skill.
Cover: narrative clarity, pacing, technical quality, content alignment,
engagement. For each question, explain why it's open-ended vs yes/no.
```

### Prompt 4: Build Complete Skill File

```
Help me create a complete generate-video skill file. Include:
(1) Metadata; (2) Persona; (3) Analytical Questions (5-7);
(4) Decision Principles (5 frameworks); (5) Complete usage example;
(6) Self-check validation. Format as production-ready file.
```

## Common Mistakes Addressed

1. **Creating skills for trivial patterns** (❌ 1 decision → ✅ 5+ decisions)
2. **Vague personas** (❌ "expert" → ✅ "director with film analogy")
3. **Yes/no questions** (❌ "Is this good?" → ✅ "Does narrative explain value?")
4. **Over-specific skills** (❌ "Calculator-Demo" → ✅ "Video-Generation")
5. **Skills without validation** (❌ "generate video" → ✅ "5 quality gates")
