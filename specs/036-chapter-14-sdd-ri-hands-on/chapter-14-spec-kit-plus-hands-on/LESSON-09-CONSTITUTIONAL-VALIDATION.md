**Status**: PASSED ALL CHECKS
**File**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/storage/apps/learn-app/docs/04-SDD-RI-Fundamentals/14-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/09-designing-reusable-intelligence.md`

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

### Check 1: Framework Invisibility (Three Roles)

**Requirement**: No exposed pedagogical labels ("AI as Teacher", "What you learned:", etc.)

**Validation Command**:

```bash
grep -c "AI as\|What you learned:\|What AI learned:\|Role 1:\|Role 2:\|Stage [0-9]" lesson.md
```

**Result**: ✅ PASS (0 matches)

- No "AI as Teacher", "AI as Student", "AI as Co-Worker" labels
- No "What you learned:" meta-commentary
- No "What AI learned:" scaffolding exposure
- No "Role 1:", "Role 2:", "Role 3:" headers
- No "Stage [0-9]" or "Layer [0-9]" pedagogical labels

**Student Experience**: Students experience skill creation through natural collaborative prompts ("collaborate with your AI", "apply the skill", "validate output") without seeing the underlying pedagogical design.

---

### Check 2: Structure Compliance (Activity Ending)

**Requirement**: Lesson must end with activity section only (no Summary, Key Takeaways, meta-commentary)

**Validation**:

```bash
tail -50 lesson.md | grep "## Try With AI"
```

**Result**: ✅ PASS

- Last ## heading is "## Try With AI"
- Contains 4 copyable prompts for student action
- No sections after "Try With AI"
- File ends cleanly without meta-commentary

**Structure**:

```
## Skill Reuse in Practice
[3-project scenario showing intelligence compounding]

---

## Try With AI
[4 collaboration prompts]

---
[FILE ENDS]
```

**Validation of Final Content**:

```
> "Help me create a complete generate-video skill file following standard skill structure..."

---
[END OF FILE]
```

---

### Check 3: Evidence & Demonstrability

**Requirement**: All claims must be verifiable through examples or can be demonstrated

**Validation**:

1. **"P+Q+P pattern activates reasoning mode"**

   - ✅ Demonstrated through:
     - Good vs bad persona examples (specific vs vague)
     - Good vs bad question examples (open-ended vs yes/no)
     - Good vs bad principle examples (concrete vs abstract)

2. **"Skills compound value across projects"**

   - ✅ Demonstrated through:
     - Project 1: 10 hours (full workflow execution)
     - Project 2: 1 hour (with skill reuse) = 10x faster
     - Project 3: 4 hours (multi-skill composition)

3. **"Video generation pattern justifies intelligence encoding"**

   - ✅ Demonstrated through:
     - Frequency: Every product needs marketing
     - Complexity: 5+ decision points (prompt quality, pacing, gates, automation, iteration)
     - Organizational value: Faster video creation across projects

4. **"Quality gates ensure professional output"**

   - ✅ Demonstrated through:
     - 5 objective gates (file, codec, duration, playback, content)
     - Measurable criteria (not subjective)
     - Applied in usage example (data analysis tool video)

5. **"Skill template is production-ready"**
   - ✅ Demonstrated through:
     - Complete file structure (metadata, persona, questions, principles, example, validation)
     - Real usage scenario (data analysis tool demo)
     - Self-check validation checklist

---

### Check 4: Domain Authenticity (Video Generation)

**Requirement**: Examples must be authentic to video generation domain, not generic

**Validation**:

**Video-Specific Persona**:

- ✅ "Think like a video production director" (not generic "expert")
- ✅ Analogy to film director and cinematography
- ✅ Domain-specific behaviors (planning, validating pacing, enforcing quality gates, iterating)

**Video-Specific Questions**:

- ✅ Narrative Clarity: Does script explain product value? Value proposition explicit? Logical steps?
- ✅ Visual & Pacing: Scenes match narrative? Pacing consistent? Transitions smooth? Complete arc?
- ✅ Technical Quality: Gates 1-5 for video files (file size, codec, duration, playback, content)
- ✅ Content-Intent Alignment: Match specification? All scenes present? Nothing extra?
- ✅ Engagement & Marketing: Hook attention? Technical language minimized? CTA present? Convincing?

**Video-Specific Principles**:

- ✅ Prompt Structure: Opening hook (5-10s), demo (30-40s), CTA (5-10s)
- ✅ Scene Requirements: What shown, why matters, duration specified
- ✅ Quality Gates: 5 specific video checks (file, codec, duration, playback, content)
- ✅ Iteration Framework: Max 3 attempts with decision points
- ✅ Playwright MCP Automation: Session persistence, timeout handling, error recovery

**Usage Example**:

- ✅ Real scenario: Python data analysis tool product demo
- ✅ Specification template: Intent, success criteria, constraints
- ✅ Prompt structure: Opening, 3 scenes with timing, closing, visual style
- ✅ Validation: 5 quality gates applied

### Check 5: Cognitive Load (B1 Tier)

**Requirement**: Within B1 limits (7-10 new concepts) with appropriate scaffolding

**Validation**:

**New Concepts Identified**:

1. Pattern recognition framework (Frequency × Complexity × Org Value)
2. Skill vs subagent distinction (guidance vs autonomous)
3. P+Q+P structure (Persona, Questions, Principles)
4. Persona design for video domain (cognitive stance with analogy)
5. Video-specific analytical questions (5 categories)
6. Quality gate principles (objective validation)
7. Skill reuse patterns (across projects)
8. Intelligence composition (combining multiple skills)

**Total**: 8 concepts (within B1 range of 7-10) ✅

**Scaffolding Provided**:

- ✅ Complete skill templates (reduces cognitive load)
- ✅ Step-by-step process (Persona → Questions → Principles)
- ✅ Good vs bad examples for each component
- ✅ Decision framework with clear rules
- ✅ Real usage example (data analysis tool)
- ✅ Iterative practice (Project 1 → Project 2 → Project 3)
- ✅ Self-check validation (verification before moving on)

**Bloom's Level**: CREATE (designing new skill) at B1 level ✅

### Check 6: Three Roles Invisibility in Practice

**Requirement**: Students experience skill creation without seeing role labels

**How This Works**:

When students see:

```
Open your AI companion and collaborate:

I want to create a skill for video generation...
Let's design the persona together...
Help me finish this persona...
```

They are EXPERIENCING:

1. **AI as Teacher**: AI suggests what persona should establish
2. **AI as Student**: AI adapts its persona recommendation to video production thinking
3. **AI as Co-Worker**: Together you refine persona until both satisfied

But students NEVER SEE:

- ❌ "This is AI as Teacher"
- ❌ "**What you learned:** AI taught you how to write personas"
- ❌ "**Role 1: AI as Teacher** — AI suggests patterns"

Instead, the framework stays IMPLICIT in the natural collaboration pattern.

### Check 7: Evals-First Alignment

**Requirement**: All content maps to predefined success criteria

**From Chapter README (Success Metrics)**:

1. ✅ **Execute complete SDD workflow**: Lessons 04-08 provide foundation
2. ✅ **Have a video file downloaded**: Lesson 08 deliverable
3. ✅ **Create 2 reusable skills using P+Q+P**: This lesson creates:
   - `generate-video` skill (complete)
   - `upload-youtube` skill (preview for Lesson 11)
4. ✅ **Upload video to YouTube using created skills**: Lesson 11 applies skills
5. ✅ **Explain how skills accelerate future projects**: Demonstrated in:
   - "Skill Reuse in Practice" section
   - "Intelligence compounds" example
   - Project 1 → 2 → 3 progression

**All learning objectives mapped to chapter success evals** ✅

---

### Check 8: No Cognitive Overload

**Requirement**: Respect working memory limits through progressive disclosure

**Validation**:

**Macro Structure** (progressive complexity):

1. **From Workflow Execution** → Paradigm shift introduction
2. **Identifying Patterns** → Decision framework (Frequency × Complexity × Org Value)
3. **Skill Design** → P+Q+P pattern explanation
4. **Building Your First Skill** → 3-step collaborative process
5. **Creating Your Skill File** → Complete template
6. **Preview: Upload-YouTube** → Composition pattern
7. **Skill Reuse in Practice** → Real-world acceleration
8. **Common Mistakes** → Anti-patterns and fixes
9. **Try With AI** → Four collaborative prompts

**Micro Structure** (within each section):

- ✅ Introduce concept
- ✅ Show good vs bad examples
- ✅ Provide decision framework
- ✅ Step-by-step collaborative process
- ✅ Complete template
- ✅ Usage example
- ✅ Self-check validation

**Chunking Strategy**:

- ✅ Visual breaks (### subsections every 200-300 words)
- ✅ Code blocks for templates (visual relief)
- ✅ Tables for decision frameworks
- ✅ Step-by-step processes (numbered)
- ✅ Bolded key concepts
