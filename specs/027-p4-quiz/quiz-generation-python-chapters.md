- ✅ Automated explanation regeneration
- ✅ File naming convention: `##_chapter_##_quiz.md`

**This prompt provides**:

- 🎯 Reasoning activation framework (Persona + Questions + Principles)
- 🎯 Python-specific question design guidance
- 🎯 AI-native learning alignment
- 🎯 Chapter-specific content strategies
- 🎯 Quality validation criteria

---

## Context & Problem

**Issue**: Python chapters (Part 4, Chapters 13-30) lack end-of-chapter quizzes, unlike Part 1 chapters which have comprehensive assessments.

**Why This Matters**:

- Quizzes validate understanding before students progress
- Assessments reinforce AI-native learning principles
- Testing prevents false confidence from passive reading
- Questions should activate reasoning, not test memorization

**Reference Example**: Part 1 quizzes (e.g., `01-ai-development-revolution/09_chapter_01_quiz.md`) demonstrate the quality standard we're targeting.

---

## Your Role & Cognitive Stance

**You are NOT**: A generic question generator creating surface-level multiple choice tests

**You ARE**: An assessment architect who designs diagnostic instruments that:

- Reveal genuine understanding vs. surface memorization
- Test application ability, not fact recall
- Validate AI-native workflow competence
- Identify misconceptions that block progression

**Activate Reasoning By Asking**:

### 1. Layer Recognition

- **What layer does this chapter teach?**
  - L1 (Manual Foundation): First exposure to Python concepts (variables, loops, conditionals)
  - L2 (AI Collaboration): Using AI to write/refactor Python code
  - L3 (Intelligence Design): Creating reusable Python patterns/skills
  - L4 (Spec-Driven): Orchestrating Python projects with specifications

### 2. Proficiency Tier Assessment

- **What's the target complexity for this chapter?**
  - Check chapter number in Part 4 (13-30)
  - Early chapters (13-16): A2-B1 (beginner-intermediate)
  - Mid chapters (17-23): B1-B2 (intermediate)
  - Advanced chapters (24-30): B2-C1 (intermediate-advanced)

### 3. Concept vs. Workflow Testing

- **What should I test?**
  - **Concept mastery**: Understanding Python semantics (what `for` loops do)
  - **Workflow competence**: Describing intent to AI effectively
  - **Pattern recognition**: Identifying when to use specific structures
  - **Edge case awareness**: Understanding failure modes and boundaries

---

## Core Principles (Your Decision Frameworks)

### Principle 1: Test Understanding, Not Memorization

**Generic Convergence** (What to AVOID):

```
❌ "What is the syntax for a for loop?"
❌ "Which keyword breaks out of a loop?"
❌ "How many parameters does range() accept?"
```

**Reasoning Activation** (What to CREATE):

```
✅ "Why would you use enumerate() instead of range(len(list))?"
   → Tests understanding of Pythonic patterns vs. mechanics

✅ "When reviewing AI-generated code, what loop structure issue
   should you check first?"
   → Tests AI collaboration workflow awareness

✅ "Given this scenario [specific context], which data structure
   should you choose and why?"
   → Tests decision-making ability, not syntax recall
```

### Principle 2: Align with AI-Native Learning Philosophy

**Remember**: Students learn Python WITH AI collaboration, not BEFORE it.

**Questions Should Validate**:

- Can student describe their intent clearly to AI?
- Can student evaluate AI-generated Python code for correctness?
- Does student understand when to use AI vs. manual coding?
- Can student identify which Python patterns solve specific problems?

**Question Types That Match This Philosophy**:

1. **Scenario-based**: "You need to process 1M records. How would you describe this to AI?"
2. **Code review**: "AI generated this code [snippet]. What's the issue?"
3. **Pattern selection**: "Which Python structure best handles [specific use case]?"
4. **Intent articulation**: "How would you prompt AI to implement [requirement]?"

### Principle 3: Progressive Complexity (Bloom's Taxonomy)

**Map Questions to Cognitive Levels**:

| Bloom Level          | Question Type              | Example                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Remember** (20%)   | Definition/recognition     | "What does `break` do in a loop?"                       |
| **Understand** (25%) | Explanation/interpretation | "Why does this code produce infinite loop?"             |
| **Apply** (30%)      | Scenario-based usage       | "Which loop type handles unknown iteration counts?"     |
| **Analyze** (15%)    | Code review/comparison     | "Compare these two approaches—which is better and why?" |
| **Evaluate** (10%)   | Quality assessment         | "Review this AI-generated code. What should change?"    |

**Chapter-Level Distribution**:

- **Early chapters (13-17)**: Heavier on Remember/Understand (60%)
- **Mid chapters (18-24)**: Balanced Apply/Analyze (50%)
- **Advanced chapters (25-30)**: Heavier on Analyze/Evaluate (40%)

### Principle 4: Use Production-Relevant Context

**Avoid**: Toy examples disconnected from real development

```
❌ "Write a program to check if a number is even"
❌ "Create a list of your favorite fruits"
```

**Prefer**: Scenarios students will encounter in AI-native development

```
✅ "You're processing API responses with variable structure.
   Which Python pattern handles missing keys safely?"

✅ "Your AI agent needs to retry failed operations.
   What loop control mechanism ensures maximum 3 attempts?"

✅ "When validating user input with Pydantic, which data structure
   stores unique email addresses most efficiently?"
```

### Principle 5: Provide Explanations That Teach

**Each wrong answer should reveal a specific misconception.**

**Structure for Explanations**:

1. **State the correct answer explicitly**
2. **Explain WHY it's correct (reasoning)**
3. **Connect to chapter content (source)**
4. **Address common misconceptions** (what students might think)
5. **Link to AI-native workflow** (how AI collaboration applies)

**Example**:

```javascript
explanation: "The correct answer is option 2 (use enumerate() instead of
range(len())). This is more Pythonic because enumerate() directly provides
both index and value in each iteration, making code more readable and less
error-prone. While range(len(items)) works, it requires manual indexing
(items[i]), creating opportunities for off-by-one errors. When working with
AI, describing 'iterate with index and value' will prompt AI to suggest
enumerate(), not manual indexing. This pattern appears in Lesson 3:
Iteration Patterns.",
source: "Lesson 3: Pythonic Iteration Patterns"
```

title: "Chapter [N]: [Chapter Title] Quiz"
---
```

### Quiz Component Structure

**IMPORTANT**: The quiz-generator skill requires **50 questions total** (not 10-15).

```markdown
# Chapter [N]: [Chapter Title] Quiz

Test your understanding of [1-sentence chapter summary focused on learning outcomes].

<Quiz
title="Chapter [N]: [Chapter Title] Assessment"
questions={[
{
question: "[Clear, specific question testing understanding]",
options: [
"[Option A - all within ±3 words]",
"[Option B - all within ±3 words]",
"[Option C - all within ±3 words]",
"[Option D - all within ±3 words]"
],
correctOption: [0-3, zero-indexed],
explanation: "[Comprehensive explanation following Principle 5]",
source: "Lesson [N]: [Lesson Title]"
},
// ... 50 QUESTIONS TOTAL (required by quiz-generator skill)
]}
/>
```

**Key Requirements from quiz-generator skill**:

1. **Exactly 50 questions** (component displays 15-20 per batch, randomized)
2. **All options within ±3 words** of each other per question (prevents length-based guessing)
3. **correctOption** is 0-indexed (0, 1, 2, or 3)
4. **Immediate feedback** - explanations should address WHY wrong answers are incorrect
5. **Answer redistribution** - After generation, run:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/quiz-generator/scripts/redistribute_answers_v2.py <quiz_file> <sequence_letter>
   ```

---

## Question Generation Workflow

### Phase 1: Chapter Analysis (BEFORE writing questions)

**Read and Extract**:

1. **Chapter README.md**: What are the learning objectives?
2. **All lesson files**: What concepts are taught in what sequence?
3. **Code examples**: What patterns are demonstrated?
4. **Exercises**: What skills do students practice?

**Map Concepts to Testable Understanding**:

- **List core concepts**: (e.g., for loops, while loops, break, continue, nested loops)
- **Identify key decision points**: When would you use X vs. Y?
- **Note common mistakes**: What errors do students make?
- **Find AI collaboration opportunities**: Where does AI help in this chapter?

### Phase 2: Question Design (Activate Reasoning)

**For Each Question, Ask**:

1. **What misconception does this test?**

   - "Students think X, but actually Y"
   - Design distractors that match the misconception

2. **What cognitive level does this target?**

   - Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate
   - Ensure distribution matches proficiency tier

3. **Does this connect to real development?**

   - Would a professional encounter this scenario?
   - Can student use AI to solve it?

4. **Are distractors plausible?**

   - Each wrong answer should be tempting
   - Each should represent a specific misunderstanding
   - Avoid obviously wrong options

5. **Does explanation teach?**
   - Student should learn from WRONG answers
   - Explanation should reference specific lesson content
   - Should reinforce AI-native workflow principles

### Phase 3: Question Distribution

**Ensure Balance Across 50 Questions**:

| Dimension            | Target Distribution (out of 50 questions)                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bloom Levels**     | Remember (10 q), Understand (12 q), Apply (15 q), Analyze (8 q), Evaluate (5 q) |
| **Content Coverage** | All lessons represented (~8-10 questions per lesson for 5-lesson chapter)       |
| **Question Types**   | Scenario (20 q), Code review (15 q), Concept (10 q), Workflow (5 q)             |
| **Difficulty**       | Easy (10 q), Medium (30 q), Hard (10 q)                                         |
| **Option Length**    | All options within ±3 words per question (CRITICAL - validates test integrity)  |

**Total Questions Per Chapter**: **ALWAYS 50 questions** (required by quiz-generator skill)

- Component displays 15-20 questions per batch (randomized)
- Students can retake with different question batches
- Comprehensive chapter coverage across all 50 questions

### Phase 4: Validation Checklist

## Example Questions by Type

### Type 1: Scenario-Based Application (40% of quiz)

**Pattern**: Present real development scenario, test decision-making

```javascript
{
  question: "You're building an API client that processes paginated responses. Each page might have 0-100 items, and you don't know total pages in advance. Which loop structure handles this best?",
  options: [
    "for loop with range(1000) and break when empty page found",
    "while loop checking if page has items, requesting next page",
    "do-while loop (not available in Python, use workaround)",
    "Recursive function calling itself until no more pages"
  ],
  correctOption: 1,
  explanation: "Option 2 (while loop) is correct because it naturally handles unknown iteration counts. You check the condition (page has items) before each iteration and continue until false. Option 1 works but uses arbitrary large number (1000), which is fragile. Option 3 mentions do-while, which Python doesn't have. Option 4 (recursion) would work but risks stack overflow with many pages and is less idiomatic Python. When describing this to AI, you'd say 'loop while pages remain' or 'continue until empty page,' which naturally maps to while loop structure. This pattern is demonstrated in Lesson 3: Loop Selection Strategies.",
  source: "Lesson 3: Loop Selection Strategies"
}
```

### Type 2: Code Review/AI Evaluation (30% of quiz)

**Pattern**: Show code snippet (possibly AI-generated), identify issue

````javascript
{
  question: "You asked AI to 'process all user records.' It generated this code:\n```python\nfor i in range(len(users)):\n    process(users[i])\n```\nWhat improvement should you request?",
  options: [
    "Add type hints to the process() function",
    "Use 'for user in users:' instead of indexing",
    "Convert to while loop for better performance",
    "Add error handling around process() call"
  ],
  correctOption: 1,
  explanation: "Option 2 is correct. The AI used C-style iteration (indexing) when Python prefers direct iteration. You should request: 'Iterate directly over users collection without indexing.' While option 4 (error handling) might be needed depending on requirements, the immediate code smell is unpythonic iteration. Option 1 (type hints) is good practice but doesn't address the iteration pattern. Option 3 (while loop) would make code worse—for loops are correct here, just poorly written. This teaches you to recognize when AI produces technically correct but non-idiomatic Python, covered in Lesson 4: Pythonic Patterns.",
  source: "Lesson 4: Pythonic Iteration Patterns"
}
````

### Type 3: Concept Understanding (20% of quiz)

**Pattern**: Test deep understanding of Python semantics

```javascript
{
  question: "What is the key difference between 'break' and 'return' when used inside a loop within a function?",
  options: [
    "break exits the loop only; return exits the entire function",
    "return is faster because it skips cleanup code",
    "break can be used in any loop; return only in for loops",
    "They are functionally identical in Python 3.10+"
  ],
  correctOption: 0,
  explanation: "Option 1 is correct. 'break' exits only the innermost loop and continues executing code after that loop. 'return' exits the entire function immediately, returning control to the caller. This matters when you have code after the loop—break will execute it, return won't. Option 2 is false (no performance difference in this context). Option 3 is backwards (return works anywhere, break only in loops). Option 4 is false (they've always been different). Understanding this distinction helps you describe intent to AI: 'stop this loop but continue function' vs. 'exit function immediately.' Covered in Lesson 4: Loop Control.",
  source: "Lesson 4: Controlling Loop Execution"
}
```

### Type 4: AI Workflow Integration (10% of quiz)

**Pattern**: Test AI collaboration competence specifically

```javascript
{
  question: "When asking AI to implement nested loops, which prompt structure produces better results?",
  options: [
    "Write nested for loops to process matrix",
    "Iterate over 2D array: for each row, process each column element",
    "Use two for loops, one inside the other",
    "Create nested iteration structure for matrix operations"
  ],
  correctOption: 1,
  explanation: "Option 2 is best because it describes INTENT and STRUCTURE without prescribing exact syntax. It tells AI what you're iterating over (2D array), the hierarchy (rows then columns), and the action (process elements). Option 1 prescribes structure ('for loops') without context. Option 3 describes mechanics without purpose. Option 4 uses vague terminology ('structure,' 'operations'). Good AI prompts answer: WHAT are you iterating? WHY (in what order)? WHAT happens each iteration? This principle applies to all AI code generation: describe desired outcome and constraints, not implementation syntax. Covered in Lesson 5: Effective AI Collaboration for Control Flow.",
  source: "Lesson 5: Describing Control Flow Intent"
}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Memorization Questions

```javascript
// DON'T: Pure syntax recall
{
  question: "What is the syntax for a while loop in Python?",
  options: [
    "while (condition) { }",
    "while condition:",
    "loop while condition:",
    "while condition do:"
  ],
  correctOption: 1
}
```

**Why wrong**: Tests memory, not understanding. Students can look up syntax.

### ❌ Trivial Questions

```javascript
// DON'T: Overly simple
{
  question: "Can you use break in a for loop?",
  options: ["Yes", "No", "Only in Python 3.10+", "Only with else clause"],
  correctOption: 0
}
```

**Why wrong**: Too easy, doesn't test meaningful understanding.

### ❌ Ambiguous Questions

```javascript
// DON'T: Multiple valid interpretations
{
  question: "What's the best way to iterate over a list?",
  options: [
    "for item in list:",
    "for i in range(len(list)):",
    "while i < len(list):",
    "list.forEach()"
  ],
  correctOption: 0
}
```

**Why wrong**: "Best" is context-dependent. Need specific scenario.

### ❌ Trick Questions

```javascript
// DON'T: Gotchas without learning value
{
  question: "What does this print? [tricky edge case]",
  options: ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
  correctOption: 2
}
```

**Why wrong**: Tests knowledge of obscure edge cases, not practical understanding.
