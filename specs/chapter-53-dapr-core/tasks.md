## Implementation Notes

### Parallel Execution
- L00 must complete before L01-L10 (skill context needed)
- L01-L02 can run in parallel (both conceptual)
- L03-L08 should run sequentially (progressive building)
- L09 requires L03-L08 complete (uses all building blocks)
- L10 requires L09 complete (finalizes skill)

### Subagent Configuration
All content-implementer invocations MUST include:
- Absolute output path
- Quality reference lesson path
- Expertise skill reference: .claude/skills/building-with-dapr/SKILL.md
- Autonomous execution directive
- File verification after completion

### Content Quality Requirements
Every lesson MUST have:
1. Full YAML frontmatter with skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load
2. Compelling narrative opening (2-3 paragraphs before first section)
3. 3 "Try With AI" prompts with "What you're learning:" explanations
4. Evidence blocks for all code examples
5. "Reflect on Your Skill" section (except L00 and L10)
6. NO sections after "Try With AI"
