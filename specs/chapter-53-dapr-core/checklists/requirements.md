# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 53 - Dapr Core

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: [specs/chapter-53-dapr-core/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Focuses on what students learn, not how to code it
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Educational outcomes and skill ownership
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Explains concepts before technical details
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - Overview, Assumed Knowledge, Lessons, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All decisions made
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - FR-001 through FR-010 are specific
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - SC-001 through SC-006 have metrics
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - Focus on student outcomes
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 5 user stories with Given/When/Then
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Sidecar readiness, component errors, app-id conflicts
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Explicitly excludes Actors/Workflows (Ch59)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Prerequisites listed, Assumed Knowledge documented

## Educational Content Quality

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section included - What students know BEFORE and what chapter explains
- [x] Proficiency level specified (B1 - Intermediate)
- [x] Skill-First pattern followed - L00 creates skill FIRST
- [x] Every lesson has "Reflect on Your Skill" section requirement (FR-002)
- [x] Layer progression documented (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4)
- [x] Capstone connects to Part 6 agent (Task API refactoring)
- [x] Quality reference lesson specified (Ch52)
- [x] Expertise skill reference included (.claude/skills/building-with-dapr/)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (skill creation, deployment, building blocks, capstone)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` and `/sp.plan`.

**Key decisions made**:
- 11 lessons total (L00-L10)
- Redis for both state and pub/sub (simpler than Kafka for initial Dapr learning)
- Docker Desktop Kubernetes (consistent with Ch49-51)
- Dapr 1.14+ (latest stable)
- Actors/Workflows deferred to Ch59
