# Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature**: Origin Story Lesson Enhancement
**Spec File**: `specs/042-origin-story-enhancement/spec.md`
**Validated**: 2025-12-17
**Agent**: spec-architect v3.0

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec correctly focuses on content structure, narrative flow, and pedagogical outcomes rather than technical implementation. Target audience (A2 learners) clearly identified.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3 prioritized)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (constraints + non-goals)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria. Edge cases identified (reader skips sections, source unavailable, metrics change). Non-goals explicitly prevent scope creep.

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Evals-first pattern followed (evals before spec)

**Notes**: 4 user stories with independent tests and acceptance scenarios. Success criteria map directly to functional requirements.

---

## Formal Verification

- [x] Invariants identified and documented
- [x] Small scope test passed (3-5 instances)
- [x] No counterexamples found (or all addressed)
- [x] Relational constraints verified (cycles, coverage, uniqueness)

**Notes**: Low complexity spec (content enhancement). No multi-component systems or state machines requiring formal verification.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: READY
**Readiness Score**: 9.5/10

- Testability: 10/10
- Completeness: 10/10
- Ambiguity: 9/10 (minor - see issues below)
- Traceability: 9/10

**Strengths**:
- Concrete success criteria (100% traceability, zero closure phrases, 3 misconception challenges)
- Clear factual accuracy mandate with source attribution requirements
- Narrative structure requirements enforce pedagogical effectiveness
- Edge cases thoughtfully identified
- Non-goals prevent scope creep

**Minor Improvements**:
- Clarify whether existing "Try With AI" section should be preserved verbatim or enhanced
- Specify whether comparison table format should match existing or be redesigned
- Define "internal critique checklist" referenced in SC-007

**Next Steps**: Proceed to planning phase. No critical blockers identified.
