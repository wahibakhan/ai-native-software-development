## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - L1 lessons build vocabulary
- **Application (Phase 3-4)**: Depends on Foundational - L2 lessons require L1 mental models
- **Intelligence (Phase 5)**: Depends on Application - L3 lessons build on L2 patterns
- **Capstone (Phase 6)**: Depends on Intelligence - L4 integrates all previous layers
- **Assessment (Phase 7)**: Depends on Capstone - Quiz covers all content
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all lessons complete

### Layer Transitions

- **L1→L2** (after T009): Students have SDK vocabulary
- **L2→L3** (after T021): Students have AI collaboration patterns
- **L3→L4** (after T029): Students have reusable intelligence
- **L4 Complete** (after T033): Students have Digital FTE capstone

### Parallel Opportunities

Within each phase, summary file tasks [P] can run in parallel with next lesson.

```bash
# Example: Phase 3 parallel execution
Task: T010 (Lesson 4 content)
Task: T011 (Lesson 4 summary) # Parallel after T010 completes
Task: T012 (Lesson 5 content) # Can start while T011 runs
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Lessons 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (L1 Lessons 1-3)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test L1 foundation independently
4. Proceed to L2 if L1 validated

### Incremental Delivery

1. L1 Foundation (Lessons 1-3) → Validate → Checkpoint
2. L2 Unique Features (Lessons 4-9) → Validate → Checkpoint
3. L3 Intelligence (Lessons 10-13) → Validate → Checkpoint
4. L4 Capstone (Lessons 14-15) → Validate → Checkpoint
5. Assessment (Lesson 16) → Final validation
