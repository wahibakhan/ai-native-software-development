## Summary

| Phase                    | Tasks                | Est. Time | Priority |

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Research Phase (Phase 0)

- TASK-001 and TASK-002 can run in parallel

### Content Phases (Phases 1-3)

- Content tasks are sequential (each lesson builds on prior)
- However, diagrams (Phase 4) can be created in parallel with content

### Visual Assets (Phase 4)

- TASK-012, TASK-013, TASK-014, TASK-015 can all run in parallel
- Each can start as soon as dependent content task is complete

### QA Phase (Phase 5)

- TASK-016, TASK-017, TASK-018, TASK-019 can run in parallel after all content complete

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Paper Alignment** (MOST CRITICAL): All frameworks must match Google "Introduction to Agents" paper exactly
2. **No Old Framework Leakage**: Must NOT use "Agency Spectrum", "5 Components", "ReAct pattern", "Plan-Execute pattern"
3. **Pedagogical Progression**: L1 (Lessons 1-3) → L2 (Lessons 4-7) → L3 (Lesson 8)
4. **Anti-Convergence**: Three Roles framework invisible, no meta-commentary
5. **Citation Accuracy**: All statistics verified and cited
6. **Production Quality**: Diagrams professional, content polished

---

## Implementation Notes

**Content Author Policy**:

- Each lesson ends with "Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways", no "What's Next")
- Students have completed Parts 1-5 — instruct to use preferred AI companion (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, ChatGPT)
- Action prompts only in "Try With AI" — no meta-commentary exposing Three Roles framework

**Layer Progression**:

- Lessons 1-3: Layer 1 (Manual Foundation) — No "Tell your AI..." in main content
- Lessons 4-7: Layer 2 (AI Collaboration) — "Try With AI" demonstrates partnership
- Lesson 8: Layer 3 (Synthesis) — Apply all frameworks to create agent specification

**Primary Source Priority**:

1. Google/Kaggle "Introduction to Agents" whitepaper (November 2025) — AUTHORITATIVE
2. McKinsey "Agents, robots, and us" — Statistics only
3. SDK official documentation — Lesson 7 only
