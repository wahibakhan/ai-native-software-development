## TASK-016: Paper Alignment Validation

### ✅ PASS: All 4 Frameworks Covered

**Requirement**: Lesson MUST describe 4+ agent frameworks with 2-3 distinguishing characteristics each.

**Verification**:

1. **Framework 1: OpenAI Agents SDK** ✅

   - Philosophy: Simplicity first, tight GPT integration
   - Characteristic 1: Model integration (function calling native)
   - Characteristic 2: Developer experience (minimal configuration)
   - Characteristic 3: Production features (structured outputs, logging, rate limiting)

2. **Framework 2: Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** ✅

   - Philosophy: Production-grade, enterprise features
   - Characteristic 1: Agent Engine with built-in memory
   - Characteristic 2: MCP support and extensibility
   - Characteristic 3: Callbacks and model selection flexibility

3. **Framework 3: Anthropic Agents Kit** ✅

   - Philosophy: Safety-first, transparency, interpretability
   - Characteristic 1: Extended thinking (deep reasoning before response)
   - Characteristic 2: Constitutional AI principles (values/constraints embedded)
   - Characteristic 3: Interpretability (transparent reasoning traces)

4. **Framework 4: LangChain** ✅
   - Philosophy: Model-agnostic, composability-first
   - Characteristic 1: Any model support (not locked to single provider)
   - Characteristic 2: Extensive tool ecosystem and community
   - Characteristic 3: Composition patterns for building complex agents

### ✅ PASS: Framework Selection Guidance

**Requirement**: Lesson should provide decision framework for SDK selection.

**Evidence**:

- Each framework includes "When to use" section ✅
- Scenario-based guidance provided ✅
- "Transferability" principle emphasized ✅
- Clear messaging that concepts transfer across frameworks ✅

### ✅ PASS: Paper Frameworks Referenced

**Requirement**: SDK landscape should connect to 3+1 Architecture from Lesson 2.

**Evidence**:

- OpenAI framework maps to 3+1 Architecture ✅
- Google ADK components aligned with paper ✅
- Each framework's architectural completeness evaluated ✅

### ✅ PASS: Learning Objectives Met

**LO7.1**: Name 4+ agent frameworks and describe philosophy

- All 4+ frameworks named with clear philosophies ✅

**LO7.2**: Articulate 2-3 distinguishing characteristics

- Each framework has 3+ characteristics ✅

**LO7.3**: Understand framework selection factors

- Decision guidance provided for each framework ✅

**LO7.4**: Recognize concept transfer across frameworks

- Transferability explicitly emphasized ✅

**LO7.5**: Identify production-relevant features

- Monitoring, security, deployment covered for each ✅

## TASK-017: Anti-Convergence Validation

### ✅ PASS: No Meta-Commentary Found

- No "AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker" labels ✅
- No "What to notice" meta-commentary ✅
- No pedagogical framework exposition ✅
- Action prompts used correctly ✅

---

## TASK-018: Citation Verification

### ✅ PASS: Framework Citations Accurate
