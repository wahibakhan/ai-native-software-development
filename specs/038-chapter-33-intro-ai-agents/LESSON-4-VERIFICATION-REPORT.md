## Learning Objectives Alignment

### LO4.1: Name and Describe 4 Patterns

**Status**: ✅ FULLY ADDRESSED

**Coverage**:

- Pattern 1: Coordinator (4 subsections: Problem, Architecture, Example, Use Cases)
- Pattern 2: Sequential (4 subsections: Problem, Architecture, Example, Use Cases)
- Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement (4 subsections: Problem, Architecture, Example, Use Cases)
- Pattern 4: Human-in-the-Loop (4 subsections: Problem, Architecture, Example, Use Cases)

Each pattern section includes:

- "The Problem It Solves" (clear definition)
- "The Architecture" (explanation of how it works)
- "Visual Model" (ascii diagram)
- "Real-World Example" (concrete scenario)
- "Use Cases" (3-5 applications)
- "Trade-Offs" (advantages/disadvantages)

**Assessment Path**: Prompt 1 in "Try With AI" directly assesses naming and description skills

---

### LO4.2: Match Use Cases to Patterns

**Status**: ✅ FULLY ADDRESSED

**Coverage**:

- ✅ Each pattern includes 3-5 explicit use cases
- ✅ Real-world example demonstrates matching process
- ✅ Decision framework section provides matching criteria
- ✅ Decision tree visual shows matching logic
- ✅ All four "Try With AI" prompts require matching (Prompt 1, 2, 3, Stretch)

**Assessment Path**: "Try With AI" prompts require students to match scenarios to patterns (Prompt 1 contract review, Prompt 3 customer support system, Stretch their own scenario)

---

### LO4.3: Explain Single vs Multi-Agent Trade-Offs

**Status**: ✅ FULLY ADDRESSED

**Coverage**:

- ✅ Opening section: "Why Multi-Agent Systems?" (single-agent bottleneck problem)
- ✅ "Trade-Offs" section in each pattern (single vs multi-agent implications)
- ✅ "Trade-Offs: Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent" section (dedicated comparison)
  - Single-agent advantages (simplicity, latency, cost, debugging)
  - Single-agent disadvantages (bottleneck, specialization, failure modes)
  - Multi-agent advantages (specialization, parallelism, fault tolerance)
  - Multi-agent disadvantages (latency, cost, complexity)
  - Decision guidance: when to choose each

**Assessment Path**: Prompt 3 in "Try With AI" directly addresses trade-offs at scale (100,000 daily requests, cost vs accuracy vs latency)

---

## Layer 2 (AI Collaboration) Compliance

**Check**: Is this L2 content? Does it use Try With AI for collaborative exploration?

**Result**: ✅ PASS — Layer 2 AI Collaboration through Natural Dialogue

**Evidence**:

- ✅ "Try With AI" section includes 3 progressive prompts (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced)
- ✅ Prompts guide collaborative exploration (not passive information transfer)
- ✅ Expected outcomes described for each prompt
- ✅ Stretch prompt enables open-ended discussion
- ✅ Prompts are copyable (students can immediately use them)

**L2 Pattern**: Students explore patterns through AI dialogue:

1. Pattern Matching: "Which pattern would you recommend and why?"
2. Hybridization: "What would a hybrid pattern look like?"
3. Trade-Offs: "What factors influence the choice at scale?"
4. Application: "Design your own scenario and discuss with AI"

Students will EXPERIENCE pattern selection through dialogue (discovering nuances the AI suggests) rather than passively reading explanations.

## Content Quality

### Structure and Flow

**Rating**: Excellent

- **Hook**: Compelling opening explaining why multi-agent systems exist (inefficiency of single super-agent)
- **Progression**: Single-agent problem → Solution (multi-agent) → Four patterns → Decision framework
- **Pattern Structure**: Each pattern follows identical structure (Problem → Architecture → Visual Model → Example → Use Cases → Trade-Offs) — makes comparison easy
- **Synthesis**: "Trade-Offs: Single vs Multi-Agent" section steps back to big picture
- **Action**: "Try With AI" leads naturally from concept to application

### Real-World Relevance

**Rating**: Excellent

Examples chosen are concrete and relatable:

- **Coordinator**: Financial analysis (investment decision combining 4 expert perspectives)
- **Sequential**: Document processing (invoices through 4-stage pipeline)
- **Iterative Refinement**: API documentation (quality gates through generator-critic)
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Payment approval (high-stakes financial decision)

All examples demonstrate why the pattern matters in production systems.

### Pedagogical Effectiveness

**Rating**: Excellent

- ✅ Each pattern introduced with "The Problem It Solves" (relevance before explanation)
- ✅ Visual models make architecture concrete
- ✅ Real-world examples ground abstract concepts
- ✅ Trade-offs section prevents pattern evangelism (students see realistic costs)
- ✅ Decision framework gives actionable guidance (when to use each)
- ✅ Hybrid patterns show that patterns combine in practice

### Clarity

**Rating**: Excellent

- ✅ Technical terminology introduced clearly (Coordinator, Sequential, Iterative Refinement, Human-in-the-Loop)
- ✅ No jargon without explanation
- ✅ Visual models (ascii diagrams) make architecture concrete
- ✅ Examples use specific, concrete details (not generic)
- ✅ Decision tree is visual and scannable

## Comparison with Paper Source

**Source**: Google "Introduction to Agents" whitepaper, Section: "Multi-Agent Systems and Design Patterns"

**Alignment**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Pattern Coverage**:

- ✅ Coordinator — matches paper's "manager routing to specialists" pattern
- ✅ Sequential — matches paper's "assembly line" pattern
- ✅ Iterative Refinement — matches paper's "generator-critic feedback loop" pattern
- ✅ Human-in-the-Loop — matches paper's "deliberate approval points" pattern

**Terminology**: Uses exactly the paper's pattern names (not ReAct, Plan-Execute, or other alternative frameworks)

**Conceptual Depth**: Goes beyond paper by adding:

- Trade-offs section (advantages/disadvantages not explicitly in paper)
- Decision framework (not in paper but practical extension)
- Hybrid patterns (practical combinations)

**Within Bounds**: ✅ Extends paper appropriately without contradicting it
