---

## Key Pedagogical Features

### 1. Transferability Emphasis (Per Google Whitepaper)

- **Dedicated section**: "A Critical Insight: Concepts Transfer, Implementations Differ"
- **Framework notes**: Each framework shows how it instantiates architectural patterns
- **Practical effect**: Students recognize 3+1 architecture, 5-step loop across all SDKs
- **Cognitive benefit**: Reduces overwhelm by showing variations on universal patterns

### 2. Decision Framework (Not Just Survey)

- **4-question structure**:
  1. Model Constraints (which models available?)
  2. Deployment Context (where does agent run?)
  3. Feature Priority (what matters most?)
  4. Team Expertise (what does team know?)
- **Real example**: Startup scenario (2-week timeline, OpenAI expertise, customer support)
- **Practical effect**: Students learn HOW to choose, not just WHAT exists

### 3. Production Relevance

- **5+ real scenarios**:
  - Startup customer support agent (timeline + integration constraints)
  - Medical research assistance (transparency requirement)
  - Financial services (scaling + security requirements)
  - Data analysis (tool composition from multiple providers)
  - Air-gapped environment (deployment constraint)
- **Production concerns highlighted**: Scaling, monitoring, security, evaluation
- **Tradeoffs explicit**: "Flexibility and simplicity are often in tension"

### 4. Layer 1→2 Transition

- **Layer 1 foundation** (Lessons 1-6): Students understand agents architecturally
- **Layer 2 application** (this lesson): Students understand framework choices
- **Practical effect**: Prepares for Chapter 34 hands-on implementation
