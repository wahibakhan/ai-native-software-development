---

### Section 2: What Is an AI Agent?

**Length**: ~450 words
**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

Presents Google paper's definition with component unpacking:

**Definition quoted exactly**:

> "The combination of models, tools, an orchestration layer, and runtime services which uses the LM in a loop to accomplish a goal"

**Components explained**:

- **Model** ("Brain"): Reasoning engine
- **Tools** ("Hands"): APIs, databases, code execution
- **Orchestration Layer** ("Nervous System"): Planning, memory, decision-making
- **Runtime Services** ("Body"): Hosting, deployment
- **The Loop**: Feedback mechanism enabling multi-step problem-solving

**Example**: Claude Code as loop in action

**Strengths**:

- Verbatim paper quote builds authority
- Metaphorical names help retention
- Claude Code example grounds abstraction
- Clear explanation of "loop" concept (critical distinction from one-shot models)

---

### Section 3: The 5-Level Taxonomy: From LLM to Autonomous System

**Length**: ~580 words
**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTS PAPER'S TAXONOMY

**Level 0: Core Reasoning System** ✅

- Definition: Pure LLM, no tools, no planning, no loop
- Capability: Generation only
- Example: ChatGPT answering conceptual questions
- _Matches paper_: Level 0 in paper

**Level 1: Connected Problem-Solver** ✅

- Definition: LLM + tools for real-time data, single reasoning pass
- Capability: Access external data and basic actions
- Example: ChatGPT with plugins, Claude Code with test execution
- _Matches paper_: Level 1 in paper

**Level 2: Strategic Problem-Solver** ✅

- Definition: Multi-step planning with context engineering
- Capability: Active information selection per planning step
- Example: Claude Code full workflow (analyze → design → implement → test → refine)
- _Matches paper_: Level 2 in paper, explicitly named "Strategic Problem-Solver"

**Level 3: Collaborative Multi-Agent System** ✅

- Definition: Specialized agents coordinated by orchestration
- Capability: Decompose complex problems to specialists
- Example: Coordinator routing to research, technical, feasibility agents
- _Matches paper_: Level 3 in paper

**Level 4: Self-Evolving System** ✅

- Definition: Agent creates new tools/sub-agents autonomously
- Capability: Design and improve own capabilities
- Example: Agent recognizing need, creating tool, integrating it
- _Matches paper_: Level 4 in paper (frontier)

**Verification**: All 5 levels match paper's names, descriptions, and examples exactly.

---

### Section 4: Where Do You Fit Into This Taxonomy?

**Length**: ~200 words
**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

Positions student experience (Claude Code) as **Level 2** with justification:

- Multi-step planning (analyze → design → implement → test → refine)
- Context management (deciding what info is relevant)
- Iteration based on feedback

Connects to prior learning from Parts 1-5.
Bridges to deeper agent development concepts (Levels 3-4).

---

### Section 5: The Paradigm Shift: Director vs Bricklayer

**Length**: ~600 words
**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS - IMPLEMENTS PAPER'S KEY INSIGHT

**Paper's Quote Used**:

> "The traditional developer acts as a 'bricklayer,' precisely defining every logical step. The agent developer is more like a director—setting the scene, selecting the cast, providing context."

**Contrasts Explained**:

**Bricklayer (Traditional)**:

- Controls every decision
- Specifies exact sequence
- Handles every edge case
- System does exactly what programmed

**Director (Agent)**:

- Specifies goal and context
- Agent reasons how to achieve
- Provides examples of good outcomes
- Agent adapts to unforeseen situations

**Practical Example**: Authentication system

- Bricklayer: Write sequential auth code
- Director: Provide tools + goal, agent handles flow

**Implications**:

- **For Building**: Move from implementation to intent specification
- **For Reliability**: Provide context + feedback instead of handle-every-case code
- **For Complexity**: Tackle problems requiring enormous control-flow code

### Section 6: Career Implications: Why This Matters to You

**Length**: ~350 words
**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

Three career-critical insights:

1. **Transformation not replacement**

   - Jobs transform, don't disappear
   - Agent development needs human directors
   - Skills bottleneck = opportunity

2. **Skill premium accelerating**

   - AI fluency: fastest-growing skill
   - Agent design/orchestration: emerging highest-value specialization
   - Severe talent shortage predicted 2025-2026

3. **Mental models > syntax**
   - Don't need to master every SDK
   - Frameworks change; mental models transfer
   - This lesson teaches foundations; Chapters 34-36 teach SDKs

---

### Section 7: Try With AI

**Length**: ~550 words
**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS - ACTION PROMPTS, NOT META-COMMENTARY

**Setup**: Students open ChatGPT/Claude to apply taxonomy

**Exercise 1: Claude Code Classification**

- Students classify Claude Code using 5-Level Taxonomy
- Expected outcome: Level 2 recognition with reasoning
- Tests: Can students identify multi-step planning, context management, feedback adaptation

**Exercise 2: ChatGPT Scenarios**

- Students compare standard ChatGPT (Level 0) vs ChatGPT with browsing (Level 1)
- Tests: Do they understand tool access shifts levels?
- Shows: Single capability change = level shift

**Exercise 3: Personal Experience**

- Students classify AI system they use regularly
- Tests: Can they apply taxonomy independently?
- Deepens: Personal relevance

**Optional Stretch: Director Paradigm**

- Students design agent specification for order processing
- Shifts from control-flow thinking to goal + context + rules
- Tests: Can they articulate specification-first thinking?

**Expected Outcomes Specified**: Yes, all 4 exercises have clear success criteria

**Safety Note**: Included (responsible AI use reminder)
