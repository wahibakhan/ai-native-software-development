# Chapter 8: Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development — Implementation Plan

**Chapter Type**: Technical/Hybrid — Conversational CoLearning Format
**Pedagogical Approach**: Conversational CoLearning (You: [request] → Agent: [action] → Tool Output: → Agent: [explanation] → What you learned:)
**Duration**: 3.5 hours (approximately 4.5-5 hours including exercises)
**Part**: Part 2 (AI Tool Landscape) — Final chapter
**Complexity Tier**: Beginner (Part 2) — CEFR A1-A2
**Prerequisites**: Chapters 5-7 completed (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Bash Essentials)
**Target Audience**: Beginners with no Git/terminal experience
**Key Principle**: Git as the safety net for AI-assisted development (commit early, experiment safely, collaborate professionally)

**AIDD Integration**: This chapter is critical because Git enables confidence to work with AI agents. Validation-driven commits, specification-driven branching, checkpoint commits before AI sessions, and pull requests as spec reviews are core AIDD practices taught here.

---

## Chapter Objective

Learners will understand and practice Git version control and GitHub collaboration in the context of AI-driven development, specifically to:
1. Create safe checkpoints before letting AI tools modify their code
2. Safely experiment with AI-generated code using branches
3. Collaborate with teammates using pull requests
4. Use natural language prompts as a convenience layer for Git operations
5. Understand when and why to commit code, and how to track AI contributions

---

## Pedagogical Format: Conversational CoLearning

**Critical Requirement**: Every lesson MUST use the Conversational CoLearning format throughout:

### The Pattern (Repeat 3+ times per lesson)

```
You: [Your request to an AI agent or question]

Agent: [AI's response/action/explanation]

Tool Output:
[Actual output from running the command, or conceptual explanation]

Agent: [Clarification of what just happened and why it matters]

What you learned: [Reflective summary of the key insight]
```

### Key Elements

1. **"You:" (Learner Perspective)**
   - Written as first-person request or question
   - Natural language (not command-line syntax)
   - Represents what learner wants to accomplish
   - Example: "I'm worried Claude Code might break my Python project. How can I protect my work?"

2. **"Agent:" (AI Response)**
   - Friendly, conversational explanation
   - May include the actual commands to execute
   - Shows thinking process, not just commands
   - Example: "Great question! This is exactly what Git is designed for. Let me show you..."

3. **"Tool Output:" (What Actually Happens)**
   - Copy-paste of actual terminal output (for technical lessons)
   - Conceptual explanation (for foundational lessons)
   - Exactly what learner will see on their computer
   - Example: `$ git --version\ngit version 2.46.0`

4. **"Agent:" Again (Clarification)**
   - Explains what the output means
   - Connects to learning objective
   - Sets up next step
   - Example: "See? Git is installed and ready. Now let's configure it..."

5. **"What you learned:" (Reflection)**
   - Single-sentence summary of the key insight
   - Connects to AI-driven development context
   - Prepares for next concept
   - Example: "Git is now installed and configured. Your username and email will automatically appear on every commit you make."

### Why This Matters for Chapter 8

- **Accessible**: Shows real AI-human interaction, not abstract descriptions
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Learners see natural language conversations, not intimidating command lists
- **AIDD Context**: Models how learners will actually use Git with Claude Code or Gemini CLI
- **Conversational**: Maintains engaging, human tone throughout technical content

---

## Lesson Architecture (5 Lessons)

### Lesson 1: Why Git Matters in AI-Driven Development (30 min)
**Objective**: Understand the safety net that Git provides when working with AI tools
**Bloom's Level**: Understand (explain the value, not yet do operations)
**Duration**: 30 minutes reading + reflection
**Key Concepts**:
- Safety net concept (every change is reversible)
- Checkpoint analogy (video game save points)
- Collaboration pattern (multiple people, same codebase)
- Auditability (knowing who/what/when changed)

**Content Outline**:
- Opening Hook: "What if Claude Code broke your project? With Git, you're 30 seconds from recovery."
- The Three Problems Git Solves (with AI context)
  - Safety: Experiment fearlessly knowing you can roll back
  - Collaboration: Share code with teammates before merging
  - Auditability: Track which AI tool made which changes
- Real-World Scenarios
  - Solo developer experimenting with AI refactoring
  - Team reviewing AI-generated feature before merging
  - Debugging: "When did this bug appear? Which AI session introduced it?"
- Analogy: Git as versioning in video games, tracks in film production, checkpoints in sports
- Why Part II matters: Natural language prompts make Git more accessible

**Content Elements**:
- 4-5 concrete examples (AI refactor with rollback, team PR review, bug hunt with git log, accidental secret committed, etc.)
- Visual: Simple diagram showing branches as experiment paths
- NO code examples yet (this lesson is conceptual)

**Practice Approach**:
- Reflection prompts: "Can you think of a time you've worked on code with others? What went wrong?"
- Peer insight: "If you were reviewing code from Claude Code, what would concern you?"

**Prerequisites**: None—foundational lesson

**Scaffolding**: Heavy support; establishes motivation before teaching commands

---

### Lesson 2: Git Essentials: Commands and Setup (90 min)
**Objective**: Install Git, configure it, and execute the basic workflow (status → add → commit → push)
**Bloom's Level**: Apply (execute commands independently)
**Duration**: 90 minutes (45 min content + 45 min exercises)
**Key Concepts**:
- Git installation (platform-specific)
- Configuration (user identity for commits)
- Working directory vs. staging area vs. repository

- Part I: Installation & Setup
  - Windows-specific instructions (Git Bash)
  - macOS instructions (Homebrew or installer)
  - Linux instructions (apt/brew)
  - Verification: `git --version` and `git config --list`
  - Configuration: `git config --global user.name`, `git config --global user.email`
- Part II: The Core Workflow (Show-Then-Explain)
  - Demonstrate complete workflow: init → status → add → commit → push
  - Each command includes: what it does, why you use it, what it outputs
  - Three-stage concept: working directory → staging area → repository (with diagram)
- Part III: Reading Git Output
  - Understanding `git status` output (untracked, modified, staged)
  - Understanding `git log` output (commit messages, authors, timestamps)
  - Interpreting error messages
- Part IV: Commit Messages with AI Attribution
  - Best practices: present tense, descriptive, linkable
  - AI attribution pattern: `[AI] Claude - Add error handling for API timeout`
  - Why this matters: auditability, understanding evolution

**Content Elements**:
- Code examples: 3-4 complete workflows (Python project, Node.js project, etc.)
- All examples include expected output
- Platform-specific notes (Windows/Mac/Linux) for commands that differ
- Troubleshooting subsection: common installation issues and fixes
- No jargon: define "staging area", "repository", "remote" on first use

**Practice Approach**:
- Exercise 1: Install Git and verify (`git --version`)
- Exercise 2: Configure user identity
- Exercise 3: Initialize a new repository
- Exercise 4: Make a commit with a good commit message
- Exercise 5: View commit history with `git log --oneline`

**Prerequisites**: Bash basics from Chapter 7 (terminal navigation)

**Scaffolding**: Show commands first, explain each component, then independent practice

---

### Lesson 3: Safe Experimentation: Branches, Checkpoints, and Rollback (90 min)
**Objective**: Create checkpoints before AI changes, safely rollback if needed, experiment with branches
**Bloom's Level**: Apply (create branches, make commits, reset safely)
**Duration**: 90 minutes (40 min content + 50 min exercises)
**Key Concepts**:
- Checkpoint as a named commit
- Branching as parallel development paths
- HEAD pointer and state management
- Rolling back with `git reset` (soft vs. hard)
- Reverting with `git revert` (safe alternative)
- Merge strategies (fast-forward vs. three-way)

**Content Outline**:
- Opening Hook: "Before you let Claude Code refactor your project, save a checkpoint."
- Part I: The Checkpoint Pattern
  - Commit as checkpoint: `git commit -m "Stable state before AI refactoring"`
  - Reading commit history: understanding what each checkpoint represents
  - Best practice: commit before every AI session
- Part II: Branch-Based Experimentation
  - Why branches: safe isolation, experiment without affecting main
  - Creating and switching: `git checkout -b feature-branch`
  - List branches: `git branch`
  - Switching between branches: `git checkout main`
  - Use case: let Claude Code experiment on a branch, test results, decide to merge or discard
- Part III: Undoing Changes (The Safety Net)
  - Soft reset: `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (undo commit, keep changes staged)
  - Hard reset: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (undo commit and discard changes)
  - Revert: `git revert COMMIT_HASH` (safe alternative, creates new commit)
  - When to use each
- Part IV: Merging Branches
  - Fast-forward merge (linear history)
  - Three-way merge (creating merge commit)
  - Handling merge conflicts (conflict markers, manual resolution, asking AI for help)
  - Merge vs. rebase philosophy (choosing safety over perfection)
- Part V: Stashing (Temporary Save)
  - `git stash` to save uncommitted work temporarily
  - Use case: need to switch branches but not ready to commit

**Content Elements**:
- Code examples: 4-5 complete workflows
  - Checkpoint → experiment → success → merge
  - Checkpoint → experiment → failure → rollback to checkpoint
  - Branch creation and merging
  - Merge conflict with resolution
- Visual diagram: branch visualization showing experiment paths and merges
- Troubleshooting: "Accidentally committed on wrong branch?", "Committed something I shouldn't?"

**Practice Approach**:
- Exercise 1: Create a checkpoint commit
- Exercise 2: Create a feature branch and make changes
- Exercise 3: Switch between branches and observe file changes
- Exercise 4: Merge the branch back to main
- Exercise 5: Rollback a commit using `git reset --hard` (in isolated example)
- Exercise 6: Create and resolve a simple merge conflict

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 2 (basic workflow)

**Scaffolding**: Build from checkpoint concept → branches → safe undoing → merging

---

### Lesson 4: Pull Requests and Team Collaboration (75 min)

**Duration**: 75 minutes (35 min content + 40 min exercises)
**Key Concepts**:
- Pull request as a code review mechanism
- GitHub PR interface (creating, describing, reviewing)
- Review feedback and iteration
- Merge strategies on GitHub (squash, rebase, merge commit)
- Branch protection and best practices
- Resolving conflicts in PR

**Content Outline**:
- Opening Hook: "Pull requests let teammates review AI code before it ships."
- Part I: Understanding PRs (Conceptually)
  - What is a PR? Proposed changes from one branch to another
  - Why PRs? Code review, discussion, auditing
  - PR vs. merge: PR is proposal, merge is execution

- Exercise 6: Merge the PR on GitHub
- Exercise 7 (optional): Create and resolve a merge conflict in a PR

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 3 (branches and merging), GitHub account

**Scaffolding**: Show PR interface first, then explain concepts, then independent practice

---

### Lesson 5: Natural Language Prompts for Git Operations (Part II) (45 min)
**Objective**: Use Claude Code or Gemini CLI to execute Git commands via natural language; understand when to use this convenience layer
**Bloom's Level**: Apply (translate commands to prompts, execute via AI CLI)
**Duration**: 45 minutes (15 min concept + 30 min exercises/examples)
**Key Concepts**:
- Natural language as convenience layer (not replacement for understanding)
- AI CLI tools: Claude Code, Gemini CLI
- Prompt patterns for Git operations
- Complex workflows via prompts (combining multiple operations)
- When to use natural language vs. direct commands
- Troubleshooting prompts (conflict help, error explanation)

**Content Outline**:
- Opening Hook: "If you find Git commands intimidating, let your AI assistant handle the syntax."
- Part I: Why Natural Language Prompts? (Mindset)
  - Prompts reduce memorization burden
  - But still understand what commands do
  - AI as a syntax translator, not a replacement for knowledge
  - When to use: need exact commands, when overwhelmed by syntax
  - When NOT to use: when learning, when you need to understand what's happening
- Part II: Command-to-Prompt Translation
  - Single commands: `git status` → "What changes are in my working directory?"
  - Chained commands: Creating checkpoint → branching → committing → pushing
  - Realistic translations for 10+ common Git scenarios
  - Examples:
    - "Create a safety checkpoint with message 'Stable before AI refactoring'"
    - "Create a new branch called feature-auth and switch to it"
    - "Show me the commit history for the last 5 commits"
    - "Help me understand these merge conflicts in auth.js"
    - "Stage all my changes and commit with a message describing what I did"
- Part III: Complex Workflow Prompts
  - Multi-step scenarios: "Create a feature branch, let me test AI changes, then help me decide to merge or discard"
  - Combining operations: create checkpoint → branch → let Claude refactor → review → merge
  - Example prompts for:
    - Setting up `.gitignore` for Python projects
    - Generating PR templates
    - Understanding blame output
    - Reverting a problematic commit
- Part IV: Troubleshooting Prompts
  - "I made a mistake. Help me recover."
  - "Explain this error message: [pasted error]"
  - "What did I commit? [pasted diff]"
  - "Help me resolve merge conflicts"
- Part V: Best Practices for AI CLI Conversations
  - Be specific: "Create a branch for X feature" not "Create a branch"
  - Ask for explanations: "Do that AND explain what each command does"
  - Request safety checks: "Before pushing, show me what will be committed"
  - Use for learning: "Explain this Git concept" (AI as tutor)

**Content Elements**:
- 10+ realistic prompt examples (all with expected outcomes)
- Comparison table: Git command vs. Natural language prompt vs. Output
- Real prompts that work with Claude Code and Gemini CLI
- Emphasis: prompts are convenience, not shortcuts to understanding
- All examples show AI response alongside the natural language request

**Practice Approach**:
- Exercise 1: Ask Claude Code or Gemini CLI to explain a Git concept (learning use case)
- Exercise 2: Use natural language to create a branch and commit
- Exercise 3: Use natural language to view commit history
- Exercise 4: Request help understanding a merge conflict
- Exercise 5: Ask AI to help resolve a merge conflict
- Exercise 6: Complex workflow: "I want to create a checkpoint, let AI refactor, then decide to merge"

**Prerequisites**: Lessons 1-4 (understand Git concepts), access to Claude Code or Gemini CLI

**Scaffolding**: Heavy emphasis on "this is a convenience layer", reinforce core Git understanding

---

## Lesson Dependencies and Flow

```
Lesson 1 (Why Git?)
    ↓ (establish motivation)
Lesson 2 (Essentials)
    ↓ (learn basic workflow)
Lesson 3 (Safe Experimentation)
    ↓ (create checkpoints, branch, rollback)
Lesson 4 (Pull Requests)
    ↓ (team collaboration)
Lesson 5 (Natural Language)
    ↓ (convenience layer; refer back to all prior lessons)
```

Each lesson builds on prior understanding. Lesson 5 is positioned as a convenience layer that assumes mastery of core Git concepts from Lessons 2-4.

---

## Content Flow & Cognitive Load Management

### Scaffolding Strategy

**Foundation (Lesson 1)**: Establish why Git matters—motivation before commands. No syntax, no overwhelm. Just stories and scenarios.

**Core Skills (Lessons 2-3)**: Teach Git with heavy scaffolding:
- Show complete workflow first
- Explain each part
- Practice individually
- Progress from status/add/commit (simplest) → branches and rollback (more complex) → merging (most complex)

**Professional Workflows (Lesson 4)**: Now that Git basics are solid, introduce team collaboration via pull requests. GitHub UI reduces command-line friction.

**Convenience Layer (Lesson 5)**: Natural language prompts assume full understanding of core concepts. Framed as "if Git commands feel overwhelming, use this", NOT "ignore lessons 2-4 and just use prompts".

### Cognitive Load Management

- **Lesson 1**: ~30 min reading (low load, storytelling)
- **Lesson 2**: ~45 min content + ~45 min practice (medium load, new concepts but practiced step-by-step)
- **Lesson 3**: ~40 min content + ~50 min practice (medium-high load, abstract concept of branches + concrete practice)
- **Lesson 4**: ~35 min content + ~40 min practice (medium load, GitHub UI handles complexity)
- **Lesson 5**: ~15 min concept + ~30 min practice (low load, reviewing known concepts in prompt form)

**Total: ~3.5-4 hours content, +1 hour for optional exercises = 4.5-5 hours**

---

## Integration with Book and Prior Chapters

## File Organization (from directory-structure.md)

**Part**: Part 2 (AI Tool Landscape)
**Chapter**: Chapter 8 (final chapter of Part 2)
**Directory Path**: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/08-git-and-github/`

**Expected Files**:
- `README.md` — Chapter overview, learning objectives, prerequisites, summary

- `04-lesson-4.md` — Lesson 4: Pull Requests and Collaboration
- `05-lesson-5.md` — Lesson 5: Natural Language Prompts for Git

Each lesson follows the output style from `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`.

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Hybrid Structure (Part I: Commands, Part II: Prompts)
- **Rationale**: Teaches full understanding first (Part I), then shows convenience layer (Part II). Prevents natural language prompts from becoming "magic" without understanding.
- **Alternative Rejected**: Interleaving commands and prompts throughout—too fragmented, learners wouldn't understand why prompts work.

### Decision 2: Five Lessons Instead of Traditional Sections
- **Rationale**: 3-4 hours naturally breaks into 5 focused lessons (30-90 min each). Better pacing, each lesson teaches one Git concept comprehensively.
- **Alternative Rejected**: Fewer, longer lessons—would overload cognitive load. More lessons—unnecessary fragmentation.

### Decision 3: Lesson 5 Positioned as "Convenience Layer"
- **Rationale**: Prevents learners from skipping Lessons 2-4. Emphasizes that understanding comes first, automation second. Aligns with AI-first teaching philosophy (AI as partner, not replacement).
- **Alternative Rejected**: Lesson 5 as "advanced topic"—incorrectly frames natural language prompts as complex.

### Decision 4: GitHub UI Focus (Not Git CLI for Everything)
- **Rationale**: Lesson 4 teaches PR workflow via GitHub web interface, reducing command-line friction. Most learners will create PRs on GitHub web, not CLI.
- **Alternative Rejected**: Teaching `git push`, `git pull request` CLI commands—not standard, GitHub web is preferred.

### Decision 5: Safety and Rollback Emphasized Early (Lesson 3)
- **Rationale**: Addresses Risk 2 from spec ("learners fear breaking everything"). Teaching rollback early builds confidence. Safe experimentation is the core value of Git for AI-driven development.
- **Alternative Rejected**: Advanced rollback techniques late—would leave learners anxious throughout Lessons 2-3.

---

## Risk Mitigations (from Spec)

| Risk | Lesson | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Learners accidentally commit secrets | 2 | Early `.gitignore` introduction, ready-made templates, warning box |
| Fear of "breaking everything" | 1, 3 | Emphasize Git as safety net, teach rollback early and prominently |
| Platform-specific installation issues | 2 | Detailed Win/Mac/Linux instructions, verification step, troubleshooting |
| GitHub authentication confusion | 4 | Step-by-step PAT/SSH guide, error message interpretation |
| Merge conflict paralysis | 3, 5 | Explain markers clearly, show simple resolution, offer AI assistance |

---

## Notes for Implementation Team

### For Lesson Writer Agent
- Follow the lesson output style from `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`
- Each lesson should be 2,000-2,500 words (8-12 min reading) plus exercises
- Use the Show-Then-Explain pattern: demonstrate complete workflow first, then explain each piece
- Include 4-5 real-world examples per lesson, not toy examples
- All code examples must include expected output
- Platform-specific instructions clearly marked (use callout boxes for Windows/Mac/Linux differences)

### For Technical Reviewer Agent
- Verify all Git commands on Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, and modern Linux
- Test all GitHub workflows (create repo, PR, merge) with free-tier account
- Check that natural language prompts work with Claude Code and Gemini CLI
- Verify no secrets in examples (no real API keys, tokens, etc.)
- Confirm learning objectives are measurable (can we verify if learner achieved the objective?)
- Check that exercises have clear success criteria and expected output

### For Content Creators
- Do NOT assume readers know what a "repository" or "staging area" means—define on first use
- Do NOT use gatekeeping language ("obviously", "simply", "just")
- DO include screenshots of GitHub UI where helpful
- DO show complete, runnable examples with all output
- DO explain WHY each command exists, not just WHAT it does
- DO emphasize the AI-driven development context throughout (safety net for experiments, tracking AI contributions)

---

## Estimated Effort (for Planning)

- **Lesson 1**: 1-2 hours (research, writing, examples, reflection prompts)
- **Lesson 2**: 3-4 hours (installation docs for 3 platforms, 4 code examples with all output, exercises)
- **Lesson 3**: 4-5 hours (abstract concept of branches, diagrams, 5 complete workflows, complex exercises)
- **Lesson 4**: 3-4 hours (GitHub UI walkthrough, screenshots, PR workflow, conflict resolution)
- **Lesson 5**: 2-3 hours (10+ prompt examples, comparison table, exercises)
- **README.md**: 1-2 hours (chapter overview, learning outcomes, prerequisites, summary)
- **Review and Integration**: 2-3 hours (ensure consistency, cross-chapter checks, style validation)

**Total**: 16-23 hours of implementation effort (assumes one lesson-writer agent working sequentially)

| Creating Pull Requests | A2 | Apply | Communication & Collaboration | Student creates PR with title, description, and spec reference | Hands-on: PR created on GitHub |
| Understanding Code Review | A1 | Understand | Communication & Collaboration | Student explains why PRs matter for team collaboration | Short answer or reflection |

**Cognitive Load**: 3 new concepts (Remote Repository, Pull Request, Push/Pull) — within A2 limit of 7

#### Lesson 5: Natural Language Git

| Skill Name | CEFR Level | Bloom's Level | DigComp Area | Measurable at This Level | Assessment Method |
|------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Prompting AI for Git Operations | A2 | Apply | Communication & Collaboration | Student writes effective prompts like "Create a safety checkpoint" and AI executes correct commands | Hands-on: Prompt results in correct operations |
| Choosing When to Use Natural Language | A2 | Understand / Apply | Problem-Solving | Student explains when natural language prompts are better than manual commands | Reflection: "When would you ask AI to handle Git instead of doing it manually?" |

**Cognitive Load**: 2 new concepts (Natural Language Prompts, AI as Helper) — within A2 limit of 7

### Proficiency Progression Path

```
Lesson 1: A1 - Understand why Git matters (no hands-on)
    ↓ Motivation established
Lesson 2: A1 - Can install Git and make first commit
    ↓ Foundation skills working
Lesson 3: A2 - Can create branches, checkpoints, and merge safely
    ↓ Safe experimentation enabled
Lesson 4: A2 - Can use GitHub for collaboration (web interface)
    ↓ Professional workflows understood
Lesson 5: A2 - Can request Git operations via natural language
    ↓ Complete AIDD workflow ready
```

**Total New Concepts Across All Lessons**: ~16 concepts distributed across 5 lessons
- Lesson 1: 3 concepts
- Lesson 2: 4 concepts
- Lesson 3: 4 concepts
- Lesson 4: 3 concepts
- Lesson 5: 2 concepts

**No lesson exceeds cognitive load limits** (A1 max 5, A2 max 7) ✓

### Core Patterns Taught (Total: 10 patterns)

1. `git init` — Initialize repository
2. `git status` — Check current state
3. `git add` — Stage changes
4. `git commit` — Create checkpoint
5. `git log` — View history
6. `git branch` — Create branch
7. `git checkout` — Switch branch (with `-b` for create+switch)
8. `git merge` — Integrate branches
9. `git push` — Upload to GitHub
10. `git pull` — Download from GitHub

**Pattern Recognition** (same pattern repeated 3x in different contexts):
- **Pattern**: "Create checkpoint before action"
  - Context 1 (Lesson 2): Basic commit before making changes
  - Context 2 (Lesson 3): Checkpoint before creating feature branch
  - Context 3 (Lesson 5): Natural language prompt for checkpoint
  - **Result**: Learner internalizes safety-first mindset
