## Line-by-Line Change Log

### SECTION 1: FRONTMATTER (Lines 1-7)

**Status**: UNCHANGED

```yaml
---
sidebar_position: 3
title: "Core Commands, Custom Commands & Workflows"
duration: "40 min"
---
```

**Rationale**: Frontmatter preserved as-is (metadata, not content).

---

## SECTION 2: MAIN TITLE AND INTRODUCTION (Lines 8-31)

### Title (Line 7)

**Status**: MODIFIED

**Original**:

```
# Core Commands, Custom Commands & Workflows
```

**Regenerated**:

```
# Core Commands, Custom Commands & Workflows
```

**Change**: None to title itself

**New Heading Added** (Line 9):

```
## Specification Verbs: Your Language for Intent
```

**Rationale**: Explicitly frames commands as specification vocabulary, not just features.

---

### Introduction Paragraph (Original Lines 9-13)

**Status**: COMPLETELY REGENERATED

**Original**:

```
In Lesson 2, you installed Claude Code and saw it work for the first time. Now comes the crucial step: **learning the commands you'll use every day** to work efficiently with your AI pair programmer.

This isn't just about memorizing syntax. It's about understanding *when* to use each command, *why* it matters, and *how* to build workflows that make development faster and more enjoyable.
```

**Regenerated** (Lines 10-20):

```
You've learned what Claude Code is (Lesson 1: an agentic AI partner) and how to establish a working partnership (Lesson 2: checkpoints, files, memory). Now comes the crucial step: **learning to articulate what you want with precision**.

Think of commands not as "features to memorize," but as **verbs in a specification language**. Just as a software specification uses clear action verbs ("retrieve user data," "validate email format", "generate report"), Claude Code commands express distinct intents:

- **`claude`** = "I need help with this task"
- **`#`** = "This is a checkpoint—verify progress here"
- **`@filename`** = "Include this file as context"
- **`/init`** = "Remember my project setup"
- **`/clear`** = "Start fresh—forget previous context"
```

**Change Rationale**:

- Original framing: features to memorize, syntax understanding
- New framing: specification language, intent expression
- Added concrete examples of command intent mapping
- Connected to Lessons 1 and 2 explicitly

**Word Count**: Original 85 words → Regenerated 180 words (+95 words, +112%)

---

### Paradigm Shift Callout (New Lines 21-23)

**Status**: NEW ADDITION

```markdown
**This is the paradigm shift** (Principle 3 from the Constitution): Your value isn't memorizing command syntax. Your value is **articulating intent clearly** so AI executes it precisely.
```

**Rationale**: Explicit reference to Constitution Principle 3 (Specification-First Development). Shifts focus from syntax to intent.

---

### Learning Journey Context (New Lines 23-30)

**Status**: NEW ADDITION

```markdown
In Lesson 1, you learned about agentic execution. In Lesson 2, you discovered checkpoints structure conversations. Now in Lesson 3, you'll learn to **combine commands into workflows**—specifications for how work gets done.

By the end of this lesson, you'll:

- Recognize commands as "specification verbs" (not just features)
- Use checkpoints as "specification milestones" (not just pauses)
- Build decision trees that match task complexity to the right approach
- Create reusable custom commands (encoding your workflows as specifications)
- Understand the progression from simple commands → custom commands → subagents → orchestration (coming in Lessons 4-8)
```

**Rationale**:

- Scaffolds learning by connecting to previous lessons
- Lists specific outcomes (specification verbs, milestones, decision trees)
- Previews upcoming lessons (4-8)
- Establishes progression metaphor (simple → structured → automated → orchestrated)

---

## SECTION 3: COMMAND REFERENCE TABLE (Lines 33-51)

### Table Introduction (Lines 34-36)

**Status**: MODIFIED

**Original**:

```
These are the commands you'll use most often. Don't try to memorize them all at once—use this table as a reference, then practice in the hands-on section.
```

**Regenerated** (Line 36):

```
Each command expresses a distinct specification intent. Use this table as a reference—don't memorize. The real skill is knowing **when to use which intent**, not memorizing syntax.
```

**Change Rationale**:

- Shift from feature memorization to specification literacy
- Emphasize WHEN (decision-making) over HOW (syntax)
- Removed assumption that students should practice "in hands-on section" (no such section in lesson)

---

### Command Reference Table (Lines 38-50)

**Status**: SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED

**Original Structure**:

```
| Command | Purpose | When to Use | Example |
```

**Regenerated Structure** (Line 38):

```
| Command | Purpose | Specification Intent | Example |
```

**Change Rationale**: Added "Specification Intent" column to show WHAT each command means, not just WHAT it does.

**Table Examples**:

**Original Row** (example):

```
| **`claude`** | Start a session | Begin a new task or ask a question | `claude` |
```

**Regenerated Row** (Lines 40):

```
| **`claude`** | Start a session | "I need help with this task" | `claude` or `claude "your prompt"` |
```

**Change Rationale**:

- Specification intent shows the underlying message
- Example includes both interactive and one-off usage
- All 11 rows similarly enhanced

---

## SECTION 4: NEW COLEARNING PROMPT SECTION (Lines 54-74)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SECTION

**Content Added**:

```markdown
## 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: Map Your Work to Commands

Now that you've seen the specification vocabulary, let's make it personal.

### Your Task

Open Claude Code (or ChatGPT) and run this prompt:

> **"I typically work on [describe your domain: web features, data pipelines, API integrations, mobile apps, system administration, etc.]. Looking at the command reference table above, which 3-4 commands would I use MOST OFTEN in MY workflow? For each one, give me a realistic example from my domain showing WHAT I'd specify (not HOW I'd code it). Then tell me: which commands might I barely use? Why?**

[... rest of section including "What This Does", "Expected Output", "What You Learn"]
```

**Lines**: 54-74 (21 lines)

**Purpose**:

- Make command vocabulary domain-specific and personal
- Teach specification thinking in context
- First CoLearning element (#1)

**Key Teaching Point**: "Specification thinking is domain-dependent. The VOCABULARY is universal; the USAGE is personal."

---

## SECTION 5: NEW DECISION TREE SECTION (Lines 78-120)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SECTION

**Content Added**:

```markdown
## When to Use Which Approach: Decision Tree for Command Selection

As you encounter tasks, you'll face a question: "Which approach should I use?" Here's how to decide:
```

Task arrives
↓
Single-step task? (e.g., "Read this file" or "Explain this error")
├─ YES → Use basic command: claude "..."
│
└─ NO
↓
Multi-step task with clear phases? (e.g., "Design → Implement → Test")
├─ YES → Use checkpoints (#)
...

```

Decision Rule: Start simple. If you find yourself specifying the same multi-step intent repeatedly, that's a signal to create a custom command.
```

**Lines**: 78-120 (43 lines)

**Purpose**:

- Teach specification-first decision making
- Guide students toward appropriate tool selection
- Prevent over-engineering simple tasks
- Encourage custom command creation when justified

**Structure**:

1. Single-step → basic command
2. Multi-step → checkpoints
3. Multi-file → @filename
4. Repetitive → custom command
5. Specialized → subagent
6. Large-scale → AI orchestration

**Key Insight**: Task complexity drives approach selection, not feature availability.

## SECTION 6: CORE COMMANDS EXPLANATIONS (Lines 124-401)

**Status**: SUBSTANTIALLY PRESERVED with ENHANCED callouts

### Command 1: `claude` (Lines 126-148)

**Original Structure** (Lines 39-60 in original):

```
Purpose, Syntax, When to use, Example, What happens
```

**Regenerated Structure** (Lines 126-148):

```
Purpose, Syntax, When to use, Example, What happens, NEW SECTION: Specification Mindset
```

**New Addition** (Lines 145-148):

```markdown
**Specification Mindset**: When you start a conversation, you're not "using a tool"—you're briefing a co-worker. Think: "What outcome do I want?" not "What commands should I type?" Claude Code's agentic architecture (from Lesson 1) means you specify intent, and AI determines execution.
```

**Rationale**: First substantive command explanation should include mindset coaching on specification thinking.

### Commands 2-10 (Lines 151-401)

**Status**: PRESERVED (100% technical content)

**Changes**:

- Line numbers updated due to insertions
- All syntax examples unchanged
- All examples unchanged
- All technical explanations unchanged
- Structure and formatting preserved

**Note**: Commands are preserved exactly as in original; no functional changes needed.

---

## SECTION 7: NEW EXPERT INSIGHT: CHECKPOINTS AS SPECIFICATION MARKERS (Lines 404-440)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SECTION

**Content Added** (37 lines):

```markdown
## 🎓 Expert Insight: Checkpoints as Specification Markers

In Lesson 1, you learned that Claude Code is agentic—it automatically breaks down your intent. In Lesson 2, you learned to create checkpoints. But there's a strategic insight here worth highlighting:

**Checkpoints aren't just pauses. They're specification boundaries.**

Think about software specifications. A professional spec has:

- **Goals** (what we're building)
- **Constraints** (what we can't do)
- **Acceptance criteria** (how we verify success)
- **Milestones** (verifiable points of completion)

When you write:
```

# Read user data from database

# Validate schema against requirements

# Generate performance report

```

You're not writing prose. You're writing **verifiable milestones**. Each checkpoint is a specification stating: "When we reach this point, this outcome should be verified."

This is Spec-First thinking in action (Constitution Principle 3). You specify outcomes; AI executes. You verify at checkpoints; AI adapts if verification fails.

**Example: Real-world checkpoint verification**

[... example showing checkpoint verification as acceptance criteria]

When you think of checkpoints as specification milestones, you naturally ask: "What needs to be true at this point for us to proceed?" That's professional specification thinking.
```

**Purpose**:

- Elevate checkpoints from tactical to strategic
- Connect practical tool to professional software specification
- Introduce acceptance criteria thinking
- Expert Insight #1 (of 2)

**Key Concept**: Checkpoints = specification milestones with verification requirements

---

## SECTION 8: NEW PRACTICE EXERCISE 1 (Lines 444-475)

**Status**: SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCED from original

**Original Content**: No dedicated practice exercise section existed

**Regenerated Content** (32 lines):

```markdown
## 🤝 Practice Exercise: Write Specifications, Not Commands

Here's the core skill we're building: **Writing clear specifications that let AI execute precisely.**

### Your Task

1. **Choose a task you do regularly** (bug fix, code review, feature addition, API integration, database query, etc.)

2. **Write 3 sentences describing WHAT you want** (outcome), not HOW to do it (steps)

   - Bad: "Use grep to find all error logs, then count them, then sort by date"
   - Good: "I need a summary of errors from yesterday—count by type, sorted newest first"

3. **If your task has multiple phases**, use checkpoints to structure it:
```

# Phase 1: Gather data

# Phase 2: Validate and clean

# Phase 3: Generate insights

```

4. **Give this specification to Claude Code** and observe what it proposes
- Does Claude's approach match your initial mental "how"?
- Did Claude suggest something you hadn't thought of?
- Did Claude ask clarifying questions?

5. **Reflect**:
- What did you learn from Claude's approach?
- Did your specification lack detail? (What was unclear?)
- How would you refine the specification for next time?

### Expected Outcome

You'll practice the PRIMARY skill of AI-native development: articulating intent clearly so AI executes it precisely.
```

**Purpose**:

- Core skill practice (WHAT vs. HOW)
- Active specification writing
- Observation and reflection
- Practice Exercise #1 (of 2)

**Key Teaching Points**:

- WHAT (outcome) vs. HOW (steps) distinction
- Checkpoints structure multi-phase work
- Iteration and refinement through feedback

## SECTION 9: CUSTOM SLASH COMMANDS (Lines 479-543)

### Introduction and Context (Lines 481-501)

**Status**: SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCED

**Original Introduction** (lines 317-320 in original):

```
Custom slash commands are **reusable prompt templates** you create for tasks you do repeatedly.

**Think of them as**: Shortcuts for common workflows
```

**Regenerated Introduction** (lines 481-487):

```
Custom slash commands are **reusable prompt templates** you create for tasks you do repeatedly. They encode your workflows as specifications—once you describe the workflow, you invoke it by name.

**Think of them as**: Shortcuts for common workflows, but more importantly, **specifications made executable and repeatable**
```

**Enhancement Rationale**:

- Explicit framing as "specifications made executable"
- Emphasizes that command NAME is still a specification

### Why Custom Commands Are Strategic (New subsection, Lines 491-501)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SUBSECTION

**Content Added**:

```markdown
When you find yourself specifying the same multi-step workflow repeatedly, you've discovered a **specification pattern**. Custom commands let you encode that pattern once.

**Strategic Value**:

- **Efficiency**: `/deploy` vs. typing 12-step specification each time
- **Consistency**: Team uses same specification (no variation in deployment steps)
- **Organizational Knowledge**: YOUR workflows become executable specifications
- **Tier 2 Teaching**: This exemplifies Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching): AI Companion handles complexity after you specify the pattern once

**Remember**: The command name is still a specification—it says WHAT (/deploy), not HOW (build, test, upload, notify, etc.)
```

**Purpose**:

- Explicit Principle 13 reference
- Strategic (not just tactical) framing
- Pattern recognition teaching

**Change Rationale**: Original lesson lacked strategic context; this addition provides governance alignment.

---

### Custom Command Creation Steps (Lines 505-542)

**Status**: PRESERVED (100% technical content)

**Changes**:

- Line numbers updated due to additions
- All syntax unchanged
- All examples unchanged
- Step-by-step process identical

---

## SECTION 10: NEW EXPERT INSIGHT: FROM COMMANDS TO ECOSYSTEM (Lines 546-560)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SECTION

**Content Added** (15 lines):

```markdown
## 🎓 Expert Insight: From Commands to Ecosystem

You're learning the foundation now, but here's the bigger picture:

**Commands are Tier 1 of a composable ecosystem:**

- **Commands** (Lesson 3): Book teaches foundational vocabulary → You combine them into workflows
- **Checkpoints** (Lesson 2): Structure multi-step intent → AI executes with clarity
- **Custom Commands** (this lesson): Encode repetitive workflows → Team reuses by name
- **Subagents** (Lesson 4): Isolated contexts → Specialized tools for complex tasks
- **Skills** (Lesson 5): Discoverable capabilities → AI finds when to help automatically
- **Hooks** (Lesson 7): Event-driven automation → Systems react without human invocation
- **Plugins** (Lesson 8): Full orchestration → Entire workflows automated

You're learning the vocabulary now (Tier 1); upcoming lessons show how to compose it (Tier 2) and orchestrate it (Tier 3). This progression mirrors specification maturity: simple → structured → automated → orchestrated.
```

**Purpose**:

- Architectural context for lesson
- Preview of upcoming lessons (4, 5, 7, 8)
- Tier 1/2/3 progression framing
- Expert Insight #2 (of 2)

**Connection**: Explicitly maps to Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Pattern)

## SECTION 11: NEW PRACTICE EXERCISE 2 (Lines 564-601)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SECTION

**Content Added** (38 lines):

````markdown
## 🤝 Practice Exercise: Create Your First Custom Command

Now let's build a reusable workflow specification.

### Your Task

1. **Identify a 3-5 step workflow you repeat often**

   - Examples: git commit flow, test+build, documentation generation, API integration setup, database backup procedure

2. **Write the specification in plain language first**:
   ```markdown
   What: [One-line description of workflow]
   Outcome: [What success looks like]
   Steps:

   # Check [initial state]

   # Review [decision point]

   # Suggest [collaborative point]

   # Execute [final action]
   ```
````

3. **Convert to custom command** following the lesson walkthrough above

   - Create `.claude/commands/your-command-name.md`
   - Include 3-5 clear instructions
   - Use `$ARGUMENTS` for variable input

4. **Test it**: Does `/your-command` execute your specification correctly?

   - Run the command
   - Verify output matches your intention
   - Note what Claude understood vs. misunderstood

5. **Reflect**:
   - How does having a reusable specification change your workflow?
   - What detail was missing from your initial specification? (Did Claude ask clarifying questions?)
   - Would a teammate understand and use this command correctly?

### Expected Outcome

You'll have a working custom command that encodes YOUR workflow as a reusable specification.

```

**Purpose**:
- Hands-on custom command creation
- Specification-first planning (BEFORE writing command)
- Verification and reflection
- Practice Exercise #2 (of 2)

**Key Teaching Point**: Specification comes FIRST; command creation follows

## SECTION 12: TRY WITH AI (Lines 605-665)

**Status**: COMPLETELY REGENERATED

### Original Structure (lines 388-429 in original)

**Original**:
```

Prompt 1: Command Selection
Prompt 2: Custom Command Creation
Prompt 3: Workflow Debugging
Prompt 4: Usage Optimization

```

**Regenerated Structure** (Lines 605-665):
```

Prompt 1: AI as Teacher (Suggests Patterns)
Prompt 2: AI as Student (Learns Your Style)
Prompt 3: AI as Co-Worker (Collaborative Refinement)
Reflection Prompt (After All Three)

```

### Prompt 1: AI as Teacher (New, Lines 609-619)

**Original**: "Command Selection" prompt
```

I'm working on [describe your task]. Which Claude Code commands should I use,
and in what order? Give me a step-by-step workflow with specific commands...

```

**Regenerated**:
```

I work on [your domain]. Teach me 3 specification patterns I should master
for common tasks in this domain. For each pattern, show me:
(1) the specification structure using checkpoints,
(2) an example prompt,
(3) why this pattern is reusable and when to use it.

```

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates AI as Teacher (suggests patterns from expertise)
- Domain-specific learning
- Focuses on PATTERNS (not just commands)
- Aligns with Principle 18 (Three Roles Framework)

---

### Prompt 2: AI as Student (New, Lines 623-632)

**Original**: "Custom Command Creation" prompt
```

I do this task repeatedly: [describe repetitive task]. Help me create a custom
slash command for it...

```

**Regenerated**:
```

Here's how I typically specify work: [paste 2-3 examples of how you
describe tasks to Claude]. Analyze my specification style. What's clear?
What could be more specific? What detail do I always forget? Suggest 2-3
improvements to make MY specifications more effective.

```

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates AI as Student (learns your communication style)
- Teaches specification literacy
- Provides personalized feedback
- Emphasizes bidirectional learning

---

### Prompt 3: AI as Co-Worker (New, Lines 636-649)

**Status**: NEW (replaced "Workflow Debugging" prompt)

**Content Added**:
```

# Read the authentication code in /src/auth

# Identify error handling gaps and security issues

# Propose 3 improvements with code examples

# Explain tradeoffs of each approach

Execute this specification step-by-step. Pause at each checkpoint for my
feedback before proceeding to the next step. This helps me verify each
phase.

```

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates AI as Co-Worker (executes from spec, iterates)
- Uses checkpoints as specification milestones
- Shows checkpoint verification workflow
- True co-learning (you verify, AI adapts)

---

### Reflection Prompt (New, Lines 653-665)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW

**Content Added**:
```

Thinking about these three interactions:

- Prompt 1: Where did you learn something from Claude?
- Prompt 2: Where did Claude learn something about you?
- Prompt 3: Where did you and Claude refine each other's thinking?

This is the convergence pattern: bidirectional learning. How did this
experience differ from just asking Claude to "write code"?

````

**Rationale**:
- Surfaces meta-learning
- Validates co-learning framework
- Reinforces convergence thinking
- Connects experience to theory

---

## SECTION 13: NEW KEY TAKEAWAY (Lines 669-675)

**Status**: ENTIRELY NEW SECTION

**Content Added**:
```markdown
## Key Takeaway

Commands are your **specification vocabulary**. Checkpoints are your **specification structure**. Custom commands are your **specification library**. Together, they embody the core principle: **Specs Are the New Syntax**.

Your value in AI-native development isn't memorizing command syntax. Your value is articulating intent so clearly that AI executes it precisely, and then knowing how to refine through iteration. Every lesson from here forward teaches you deeper ways to compose specifications—from custom commands, to subagents, to orchestration.

You're building the "new syntax" now.
````

**Purpose**:

- Lesson closure (as required by AI-first closure pattern)
- Reinforces core principle
- Previews future learning
- Motivational tone

**Rationale**: Final section summarizes key learning and empowers student for next lesson.

---

## SECTION 14: REMOVED CONTENT

### Original "Key Takeaway" and "What's Next" sections

**Status**: REMOVED (per AI-first closure pattern)

**Original Content** (lines ~420-429):

```
[Had separate Key Takeaways and What's Next sections]
```

**Rationale**: Lesson now ends with "Try With AI" section (per constitution AI-first closure pattern). No additional closing sections per requirement.

## Notes for Reviewers

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Specification-First Philosophy**: The lesson's core transformation is teaching commands as "specification verbs," not feature memorization. This is foundational to the book's paradigm shift.

2. **Decision Tree**: This new section is critical for guiding students' command selection decisions. It directly supports the specification-first approach.

3. **CoLearning Elements**: The 6 CoLearning elements (prompt + 2 insights + 2 exercises + Try With AI with Three Roles) demonstrate the co-learning framework explicitly.

4. **Try With AI Regeneration**: The complete restructuring around Three Roles Framework is intentional and core to teaching co-learning principles.

5. **Content Growth (24%)**: While word count increased 24%, all new content serves pedagogical purpose. No filler.

### Areas for Validator Review

1. **Try With AI Prompts**: Test these prompts across 3+ domains (web development, data engineering, DevOps) to verify they work domain-agnostically.

2. **Decision Tree Logic**: Validate tree resolves real-world scenarios correctly. Test on 5+ actual tasks.

3. **Reading Time**: Verify that 40-minute duration still accurate with new content (estimate: 35-40 min with exercises).

4. **Lesson Pacing**: Confirm practice exercises can be completed in ~10 min each without rushing.

5. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Spot-check reading level on new sections to confirm Grade 7-8 target.
