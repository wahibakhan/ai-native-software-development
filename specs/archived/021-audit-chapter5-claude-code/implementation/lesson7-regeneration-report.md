## Constitutional Alignment Details

### Principle 3: Specification-First Development

**How Lesson Demonstrates**:

1. **Opening Frame** (lines 41): "Specification-Driven Automation"
2. **Thinking Pattern** (lines 47-111): Automation Thinking Pattern teaches HOW to think in specifications
3. **Exercise 1** (lines 228-266): "Design Your First Hook (Specification-First)" emphasizes intent before syntax
4. **Evidence**: Students practice writing hook specifications before creating JSON

**Why This Matters**: In AI-native development, the skill shift is from code-writing to specification-writing. Hooks demonstrate this shift: students specify (automation pattern) once, Claude enforces (execution) forever.

---

### Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern

**Three Tiers Applied**:

**Tier 1 (Book Teaches — Foundational)**

- Understanding hook types (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit)
- Automation Thinking Pattern (tedious → hook type → matcher → action)
- Why hooks matter (strategic value, delegation, co-working)
- **Student does**: Read, understand, build mental model

**Tier 2 (AI Companion — Complex Execution)**

- Creating and configuring hooks (JSON structure, permissions, matchers)
- Troubleshooting hook issues
- Designing custom hooks for specific workflows
- **Student does**: Specify goal, understand Claude's approach, validate output

**Tier 3 (AI Orchestration — Scaling, Optional)**

- Complex multi-hook workflows (20+ hooks managing entire quality pipeline)
- Team-wide hook library design and rollout
- Advanced matcher patterns, conditional hooks
- **Student does**: Direct orchestration strategically, supervise execution

**Evidence**:

- Lines 209-211: Tier distinction explicit
- Lines 628-691: Best Practices emphasizes starting simple (Tier 1) → building confidence → optional complexity
- Lines 873-884: CoLearning Prompt invites strategic planning (Tier 3 thinking, optional)

---

### Principle 18: Three-Role AI Partnership

**Role 1: AI as Teacher** (Lines 114-121, 197-224)

- CoLearning Prompt 1: "Identify YOUR Automation Opportunities" — AI suggests domain-specific patterns
- Expert Insight: "Strategic Delegation" — explains three roles explicitly
- Prompts in Try With AI: Exercise 1 asks Claude to "Analyze... identify 3-4 automation opportunities"

**Role 2: AI as Student** (Lines 911-929)

- CoLearning Prompt 2: "Interview me about my workflow... design custom hooks specifically for my workflow"
- Try With AI Exercise 2: "Interview me... design 2-3 custom hooks specifically for my workflow"
- Evidence: Claude asks clarifying questions, listens to answers, adapts recommendations

**Role 3: AI as Co-Worker** (Lines 933-952)

- CoLearning Prompt 2: "Help me: (1) Choose hook type... (2) Write hook JSON... (3) Specify permissions... (4) Create testing plan..."
- Try With AI Exercise 3: "Build and Deploy Your Hook" — collaborates on implementation
- Evidence: Claude handles complexity (syntax), student manages strategy (intent)

**Integration**: Each "Try With AI" prompt demonstrates one explicit role. Students experience all three roles throughout lesson. PASS ✓

---

### "Specs Are the New Syntax"

**Where Emphasized**:

1. Line 41: "Specification-Driven Automation (Constitution Principle 3)"
2. Lines 47-111: "Automation Thinking Pattern" teaches specification thinking
3. Lines 228-266: "Design Your First Hook (Specification-First)" — plan before code
4. Lines 356: "Hooks are specifications you write once. They execute automatically forever."
5. Lines 961: "Hooks = Specifications"
6. Lines 961-964: Key takeaway explicitly states specs-first principle

**How Lesson Models Principle**:

- Specification (Automation Thinking Pattern) comes BEFORE code (JSON)
- Students write specifications in Exercise 1 before implementing in Exercise 2
- Closing emphasizes: you specify intent (pattern), Claude handles execution (JSON)
