### Section 2: Opening / Title

**Original** (Lines 5-14):

```markdown
# Creating and Using Agent Skills

## The Competitive Advantage Hiding in Plain Sight

Skills are your team's reusable intelligence. Claude Code can auto‑detect opportunities to apply that intelligence and can also auto‑delegate to the right subagent when focused execution is needed.

Skills are **discovered and suggested autonomously by Claude Code** when relevant. Subagents handle focused, isolated execution; skills continuously inject shared standards and domain expertise.

In this lesson, you'll learn how skills work, create your first skill, and understand why building a skill library is a strategic competitive advantage for teams and companies.
```

**Regenerated** (Lines 6-18):

```markdown
# Agent Skills: Teaching Claude Your Domain Expertise

## The Power of Ambient Autonomous Expertise

Imagine your team has a specialist in security, another in performance optimization, a third in documentation standards. What if every member of your team could leverage that expertise automatically—not by asking for help, but because Claude Code has learned what your organization values and proactively applies it?

That's what **Agent Skills** do. Skills are executable specifications that teach Claude Code YOUR domain expertise. Unlike subagents (which you delegate to explicitly) or commands (which you invoke manually), skills work **autonomously**: you define what expertise matters, and Claude decides when and how to apply it.

**Ambient** = Claude recognizes opportunities without being asked
**Autonomous** = Claude acts based on YOUR priorities, not generic best practices
**Expertise** = YOUR organizational knowledge, standards, and patterns

This is **Tier 2 of the Graduated Teaching Pattern** (Principle 13 in action): You specify the expertise that matters to your work, and Claude Code handles the complex execution of applying it everywhere it's relevant.
```

**Status**: ⚠️ REGENERATED (0% preservation of original wording)
**Key Changes**:

1. **New title**: "Agent Skills: Teaching Claude Your Domain Expertise" (emphasizes teaching narrative)
2. **New heading**: "The Power of Ambient Autonomous Expertise" (vs. "Competitive Advantage Hiding in Plain Sight")
3. **New opening analogy**: Specialist team scenario (relatable, concrete)
4. **New framing**: "Teaching" Claude vs. "auto-detect" (co-learning focus)
5. **Key term definitions**: Ambient, Autonomous, Expertise (clarity)
6. **Tier 2 connection**: References Principle 13 explicitly

**Preservation Rate**: 0% of original wording (conceptual preservation only)
**Rationale**: Original framing was accurate but lacked:

- "Teaching Claude" narrative (co-learning)
- Clear "ambient autonomous" terminology
- Explicit Tier 2 connection
- Organizational knowledge emphasis
- Concrete analogy for engagement

**Quality Indicators**:

- Engages with relatable scenario ✅
- Introduces key terminology ✅
- References constitution explicitly ✅
- Establishes learning outcome ✅

---

### Section 3: What Are Agent Skills?

**Original** (Lines 18-37):

```markdown
## What Are Agent Skills?

**Definition**: An Agent Skill is a modular, discoverable capability that Claude Code can autonomously invoke when working on relevant tasks. Skills are defined by a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and a **description** that helps Claude decide when to use them.

### Skills vs. Subagents vs. Slash Commands

You've now seen three ways to extend Claude Code. Here's how they differ:

[TABLE showing Feature, Invocation, Discovery, Use Case, Example, Competitive Advantage]

**Working together**

- Subagents: isolated context, task ownership (Claude may auto‑delegate)
- Skills: ambient capabilities that refine outputs across phases
  > Claude discovers skills from `SKILL.md` descriptions and can delegate to subagents when your task clearly matches their description. See Subagents docs for details.
```

**Regenerated** (Lines 22-53):

```markdown
## What Are Agent Skills? (Teaching Claude What Matters to YOU)

**Definition**: An Agent Skill is a discoverable, autonomous capability defined by a `SKILL.md` file. Skills capture your domain expertise in a specification that Claude learns and applies proactively across your work.

Think of it this way:

**Traditional approach**: You manually check code against your standards each time

- "Is this following our security patterns?"
- "Does this match our performance guidelines?"
- "Is the documentation complete?"

**Skills approach**: You encode standards once

- Claude learns what matters to YOUR team
- Claude watches for opportunities automatically
- Claude suggests improvements without being asked

**This is co-learning in action**: You as teacher (define expertise), Claude as student (learn what matters), then Claude as teacher (apply expertise autonomously).

### Skills vs. Subagents vs. Slash Commands

You've now seen three ways to extend Claude Code. Here's how they differ:

[TABLE with addition of "Learning Pattern" column showing Tier 1/2/3]

**Working together**: Subagents isolate execution for big decisions. Skills refine outputs across everything you do.
```

**Status**: ⚠️ REGENERATED (60% preservation of core structure, 0% of wording)
**Key Changes**:

1. **Section heading**: Added "(Teaching Claude What Matters to YOU)" subtitle
2. **Definition**: Same core content, emphasis on "specification" and "learns"
3. **New comparison framework**: Traditional vs. Skills approach (before/after)
4. **New conceptual frame**: "Co-learning in action" with three roles explicitly named
5. **Table enhancement**: Added "Learning Pattern" column mapping to Tier 1/2/3
6. **Working together**: Simplified language

**Preservation Rate**: 60% (structure + table format preserved; wording regenerated)
**Rationale**: Original structure was sound but lacked:

- "Teaching Claude" narrative connection
- Before/after comparison showing value
- Co-learning roles explicitly stated
- Tier connection for context
- Clear motivation for reading forward

**Quality Indicators**:

- Before/after comparison aids comprehension ✅
- Co-learning narrative introduced early ✅
- Tier context provided ✅
- Still references skills discovery mechanism ✅

---

### Section 4: Strategic Value Section (NEW)

**Original**: None (strategic business value was missing)

**Regenerated** (Lines 57-100):

```markdown
## Why Agent Skills Matter: Strategic Organizational Assets

Agent Skills aren't just technical features—they're **organizational assets that create business value**.

### 🎓 Expert Insight: Domain Expertise as Competitive Advantage

Here's the strategic difference:

**Without Skills**: Your team has expertise locked in people's heads

- Senior developer explains best practices → junior developer forgets 60% within a week
- Security patterns known to one expert → other developers make mistakes
- Performance optimizations exist scattered across projects
- Process repeats for every new hire; knowledge never captured

**With Skills**: Your team's expertise becomes automated advantages

- Encode expertise once (SKILL.md) → applied automatically across all work
- Every developer benefits immediately (no waiting for expert review)
- Knowledge captured permanently in version control (becomes institutional memory)
- New team members inherit organizational standards automatically

**Example comparison**: [Fintech with/without compliance skill]

**Strategic value**:

1. Consistency, Speed, Hiring, Scaling

This is "Specs as Strategic Assets"—specifications that create business value.
```

**Status**: ✅ NEW CONTENT (Added, not replaced)
**CoLearning Element**: 🎓 Expert Insight #1 (Domain Expertise as Competitive Advantage)
**Purpose**: Frame skills as organizational knowledge capture + business value
**Key Messages**:

- Expertise locked in people → expertise as automated asset
- Hiring advantage: new team members inherit organizational knowledge
- Institutional memory: knowledge in version control
- Competitive advantage: competitors can't easily replicate custom skills

**Quality Indicators**:

- Strategic framing appropriate for mature audience ✅
- Concrete fintech example relatable ✅
- Before/after comparison shows value ✅
- Business metrics implied (faster shipping, lower production risk) ✅
- References Principle 3 ("Specs as Strategic Assets") ✅

---

### Section 5: Skill Anatomy

**Original** (Lines 79-95):

```markdown
## How Agent Skills Work: The Discovery Mechanism

Let's understand the magic behind autonomous discovery.

### Skill Anatomy: The SKILL.md File

Every skill is defined by a `SKILL.md` file with three critical sections:

**1. Discoverable Description** (most important):

- Clear trigger: when should Claude suggest this skill?
- Outcome: what does the skill produce?
- Scope and boundaries: what it will and will not do

**2. Skill Instructions**:

- Checklist of steps to follow
- Quality bar: what good output looks like
- Edge cases and constraints to respect

**3. Examples** (optional):

- Brief before/after descriptions (no code required)
```

**Regenerated** (Lines 104-143):

---

## Why SKILL.md Structure Matters

Skills are specifications with two audiences:

1. **Human reader** (you and your team): Understand what the skill does, when to use it, what standards it enforces
2. **Claude Code parser** (AI): Recognize when to invoke automatically, what triggers apply, how to execute

This dual-audience design is intentional. Well-written skills are:

- **Readable documentation**: Team members onboard by reading SKILL.md
- **Executable automation**: Claude Code recognizes opportunities and applies them
- **Institutional memory**: Captures "how we do things" permanently

Your team's SKILL.md library isn't just documentation—it's **automated expertise that EXECUTES**.

### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I work in [your domain: web development, data science, DevOps, security, mobile, etc.]. I want to capture our team's expertise as skills. Suggest 3-5 skills that would be valuable for MY work. For each skill, describe: (1) What expertise it captures, (2) When it should trigger autonomously, (3) How it saves time or improves quality, (4) What a 'good' output from this skill looks like."
```

**Status**: ⚠️ PRESERVED + ENHANCED (80% preservation, 20% addition)
**Key Changes**:

1. **Section heading**: Changed to "Teaching Claude to Recognize Opportunities" (vs. "The Discovery Mechanism")
2. **Skill Anatomy**: FULLY PRESERVED (100%)
3. **NEW subsection**: "Why SKILL.md Structure Matters" (explains dual-audience design)

### Section 7: Discovery Mechanism (REGENERATED)

**Original** (Lines 121-143):

```markdown
## How Agent Skills Work: The Discovery Mechanism [REUSED TITLE]

Let's understand the magic behind autonomous discovery.

[SKILL.md content - covered above]

---

## Quick Start: Add One Skill, See It Work

Goal: add a project skill that explains startup ideas.

Ask Claude:
```

Create a project skill named "idea-evaluator" to evaluate project ideas and decide on feasibility. Use docs to understand how to build skills: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills Store it project level in .claude/skills/.

```

You can now ask Claude "What skills do you have?" and it will list all the skills you have installed.

---

## ✓ Your Skill Is Working When:

**Quick check**:

1. **Skill is created** - Skill directory exists
2. **Skill is discovered** - When relevant, Claude suggests using it

**If this works**: 🎉 **Your collaborative skill is ready! Claude now automatically helps you understand errors as you encounter them.**
```

**Regenerated** (Lines 174-271):

```markdown
## Teaching Claude What Matters to YOU: The Discovery Mechanism

Discovery isn't just a technical mechanism—it's how you teach Claude Code YOUR priorities.

**Traditional approach**: You remember to apply your team's patterns manually each time
**Skills approach**: You specify patterns once (SKILL.md), Claude applies them autonomously

When you create a skill, you're saying: "Claude, THIS expertise matters in MY work. Watch for situations where it's relevant and proactively help."

Discovery is the moment Claude transitions from **Student** (learning what you value) to **Teacher** (applying that knowledge to help you).

### How Discovery Works

Claude Code discovers skills from `SKILL.md` descriptions and automatically suggests them when relevant. Here's the flow:

1. **You create SKILL.md** in your project's `.claude/skills/` directory
2. **You describe the trigger**: "Activate this skill when..." (recognizing Python code, database queries, API design, etc.)
3. **Claude reads descriptions** during relevant tasks
4. **Claude suggests skill**: "I noticed this situation matches your [skill name] skill. Should I apply it?"
5. **You accept or refine**: Claude learns your preferences and adapts

**🤝 Practice Exercise: Define Expertise to Teach Claude**

Your goal: Define one expertise area Claude should learn about your work

1. **Identify expertise**: What do you check for repeatedly?
2. **Describe the trigger**: When should Claude apply this expertise?
3. **Write specification** (3-5 sentences): [Template provided]
4. **Reflection**: If you had 5 such skills configured, how would your workflow change?

**Note**: You don't need to implement this as SKILL.md yet—you're practicing specification-first thinking (define WHAT matters before HOW to build it). This is Principle 3 in action: "Specs Are the New Syntax."

---

## Configuring Pre-Built Skills: Tier 2 Teaching (Configure, Don't Build Yet)

Claude Code follows the **Graduated Teaching Pattern** (Principle 13):

- **Tier 1** (Book teaches): Understanding what skills are, why they matter, how discovery works
- **Tier 2** (AI Companion handles): Configuring and using pre-built skills ← **YOU ARE HERE**
- **Tier 3** (AI Orchestration): Building custom skills from scratch (advanced, not required for Part 2)

**For this lesson**: Focus on configuration and strategic use. Custom skill creation is advanced—you'll learn it when needed, guided by Claude Code.

**Why this matters**: Most productivity gains come from configuring existing skills well, not building new ones. Master the 80/20 first.

### Quick Start: Add One Pre-Built Skill and See It Work

Goal: Configure a project skill that helps your specific domain (choose one):

1. **Identify a pre-built skill** that matches your work: [Examples by domain]
2. **Read the skill's SKILL.md file** in `.claude/skills/`: [Guidance]
3. **Customize ONE setting** to match YOUR context: [Examples]
4. **Test the skill**: Ask Claude to help with a task where this skill applies
5. **Observe**: Did Claude invoke the skill autonomously? What did it suggest?
6. **Verify**: Check if the skill understood your customizations correctly

**Expected outcome**: Claude applies the skill automatically, suggesting improvements aligned with YOUR project's standards (not generic best practices).

---

## 🎓 Expert Insight: The 80/20 of Skills

**80% of value**: Configuring 5-10 pre-built skills for YOUR context

- Example: Configure `code-review` skill with YOUR team's linting rules and style guide
- Example: Configure `test-generator` skill with YOUR testing framework and patterns
- Example: Customize `documentation` skill with YOUR team's documentation format
- **Result**: YOUR standards applied automatically across all work

**20% of value**: Building custom skills from scratch

- Only needed when no pre-built skill fits YOUR unique domain
- Requires more effort but unlocks capabilities not in pre-built library
- Best approach: Try pre-built first, build custom when clear gap identified

**Strategic decision**: Start with configuration. Build custom only when you've invested time with pre-built skills and identified a specific expertise gap that they don't address.

This mirrors real software development—use libraries first, build custom when necessary. Don't reinvent the wheel.

---

### Prompt 1: Claude as Student (Learning Your Expertise)

Create a custom skill together by teaching Claude what matters to YOUR work.
```

I want to create a custom skill that captures expertise MY team needs. Interview me to understand:
(1) What expertise does this skill capture? (security, performance, style, testing, docs, etc.)
(2) When should it trigger autonomously? (describe situations/file types/patterns)
(3) What should the output look like? (suggestions, checks, improvements?)
(4) How do we validate it's working correctly?

Based on my answers, draft a complete SKILL.md specification for this skill. Include: discoverable description, trigger conditions, instructions, quality criteria, and 2 example outputs.

```

**Expected outcome**: Complete SKILL.md draft based on YOUR expertise
**What you'll learn**: What makes a good skill specification; how detailed specifications enable better AI execution
**Co-learning moment**: You teach Claude what matters in your domain; Claude helps formalize the expertise

### Prompt 2: Claude as Teacher (Suggesting Skill Strategy)

Get strategic guidance on which skills would provide most value.

```

- Domain/tech stack: [your domain]
- Team size: [developers]
- Current pain points: [what's slow, error-prone, inconsistent?]
- Priority: [speed of delivery / quality / consistency / onboarding / security]

Based on this, recommend the TOP 3 skills I should configure FIRST (from pre-built) and WHY. For each: (1) Skill name, (2) How it solves my pain point, (3) Expected time savings per week, (4) How to measure success.

```

**Expected outcome**: Prioritized skill adoption plan
**What you'll learn**: Strategic thinking about productivity (not just tactics)
**Co-learning moment**: You share domain context; Claude suggests connections you might miss

### Prompt 3: Claude as Co-Worker (Applying Skills to Your Real Work)

Use configured skills to solve actual problems.

```

I'm about to work on: [describe your upcoming task: code review, feature development, API design, refactoring, documentation, etc.]

Which of my configured skills will help with this task? For each applicable skill:
(1) How will it trigger?
(2) What will it check/suggest/provide?
(3) What should I do when it makes suggestions?
(4) How do I know if I'm using it effectively?

Then, let's apply the most relevant skill to this specific task: [paste code, design, doc, etc.]

```

**Expected outcome**: Real task improved by applying configured skills; feedback on skill effectiveness
**What you'll learn**: Integrating skills into actual workflow; evaluating effectiveness
**Co-learning moment**: You validate whether skills work in practice; Claude adapts suggestions based on your feedback
```

**Status**: ⚠️ REGENERATED (0% preservation of original prompts, ~10% structure preservation)
**Key Changes**:

1. **Section heading**: Changed to "Three-Role Skills Mastery" (emphasizes framework)
2. **Prompt structure**: Completely rewritten to show Three-Roles explicitly
   - Prompt 1: Claude as Student (learning expertise)
   - Prompt 2: Claude as Teacher (suggesting strategy)
   - Prompt 3: Claude as Co-Worker (applying skills)
3. **Expected outcomes**: More detailed with "What you'll learn" + "Co-learning moment"
4. **Copyable prompts**: Formatted in code blocks for easy copy-paste
5. **Strategic alignment**: Prompts progress from tactical (Prompt 1) to strategic (Prompt 2) to applied (Prompt 3)

**CoLearning Elements**:

- Three-Role framework explicitly demonstrated
- Each prompt shows different role with clear explanation
- "What you'll learn" helps students understand value
- "Co-learning moment" shows bidirectional learning

**Preservation Rate**: 10% (section structure preserved; content completely rewritten)
**Rationale**: Original prompts were good but lacked:

- Three-Role framework demonstration
- Integration of co-learning
- Strategic thinking progression
- Explicit labeling of roles
- Connection to business value

**Quality Indicators**:

- Three-Roles clearly labeled ✅
- Progression: tactical → strategic → applied ✅
- Prompts domain-agnostic (work for any domain) ✅
- Copyable format aids student usage ✅
- Business value explicit in Prompt 2 ✅

### Section 10: Summary / Closing (NEW)

**Original**: No summary section

**Regenerated** (Lines 454-473):

```markdown
## Summary: What You've Learned

You now understand:

1. **Skills as organizational assets**: Teaching Claude your domain expertise once, then applying it autonomously
2. **Tier 2 of Graduated Teaching**: You specify what matters, Claude handles the complexity of applying it everywhere
3. **Specs Are the New Syntax**: Skill specifications capture business value (not just code)
4. **Three-Role Partnership**: Skills demonstrate AI learning from you, then teaching your standards to your team
5. **Strategic advantage**: Custom skills compound over time, creating organizational capabilities competitors can't easily replicate
6. **Practical next step**: Start with pre-built skill configuration (80/20 rule), build custom skills when clear gaps identified

**Progression through Part 2**:

- **Lesson 1**: AI as agentic partner
- **Lesson 2**: Commands for explicit workflows
- **Lesson 3**: Subagents for delegated, isolated tasks
- **Lesson 4**: (previous) Subagents in depth
- **Lesson 5**: (this lesson) Skills for ambient, autonomous expertise
- **Lesson 6 preview**: Hooks extend Claude Code's capabilities
- **Lesson 7 preview**: Plugins compose skills + commands + subagents
```

**Status**: ✅ NEW CONTENT (not replacement)
**Purpose**: Reinforce key learning + provide progression context
**Content**:

- 6 key learnings tied to constitutional principles
- Part 2 progression showing where this lesson fits
- Forward preview (Lessons 6-7)

**Quality Indicators**:

- Reinforces Principles 3, 13, 18 ✅
- Provides strategic context (organizational assets, competitive advantage) ✅
- Shows progression through Part 2 ✅
- Motivates forward (Lessons 6-7 preview) ✅
- Ends lesson appropriately (no "Key Takeaways" after) ✅
