## Introduction Transformation

### Original (Lines 8-22)

```markdown
## Claude Code as Your Collaborative Partner (Beginner-Friendly)

Think of Claude Code like a helpful teammate sitting beside you. You ask for what you want in plain language, and Claude Code helps you do it—search the web, read docs, and work with tools—without needing to write code.

By default, Claude Code only sees your local files. But much of what you need lives elsewhere: websites, docs, APIs. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the bridge that lets Claude Code safely use external tools and data—so it can truly collaborate with you on real tasks.

In this lesson, you will:

- Understand what MCP is (in simple terms)
- Add two beginner-friendly MCP servers to Claude Code
  - **Playwright MCP**: lets Claude browse and extract information from websites
  - **Context7 MCP**: gives Claude instant access to up-to-date library and API docs
- Try two real workflows you can copy/paste and run immediately

No programming experience required.
```

### Regenerated (Lines 35-68)

```markdown
## Introduction: When Claude Needs to Reach Beyond Your Computer

You've learned how Claude Code reads your files, executes bash commands, and helps you write code. Within your local project—within your terminal, your file system, your immediate environment—Claude is powerful and in complete control.

But much of what you actually need exists _outside_ your computer:

- Real-time information beyond Claude's training cutoff (current weather, market prices, breaking news)
- Your company's database with customer data
- Websites you need to test or scrape
- APIs specific to your organization
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers

Claude Code is isolated from all of this—by design. It can't browse the web. It can't query your database. It can't access your private APIs. This isolation is actually a _security feature_. But it also means Claude is limited.

**This is where MCP comes in.**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is how Claude Code safely connects to external tools, databases, and APIs. Think of MCPs as specialized team members Claude can consult:

- "Playwright MCP, open this website and test the login form"
- "Postgres MCP, query our user database for signups in the last 24 hours"
- "GitHub MCP, create a pull request with these changes"
- "Context7 MCP, fetch the latest documentation for React 19"

But here's the critical question that this entire lesson answers: **How do you trust these external connections?**

Unlike local commands, MCPs give Claude access to external systems, data, and credentials. An untrustworthy or misconfigured MCP could:

- Leak sensitive data
- Expose API credentials
- Access data it shouldn't
- Violate compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

**This lesson teaches you to think like a security engineer: What data does this MCP touch? Whose code is it? Does it meet our compliance requirements?**

Your ability to make informed security decisions is what makes you valuable. AI can install MCPs; you decide _which_ MCPs are safe.
```

**Changes**:

- Reframed from "Claude as teammate" to "What does Claude need beyond local?"
- Surface security as central tension from line 1
- List specific external data (databases, APIs, GitHub) instead of generic
- Explain isolation as security feature
- Move from "add two MCPs" to "evaluate MCPs securely"
- Introduce the security question explicitly

**Rationale**: Security-first pedagogy (Principle 5); establish security as foundational

---

## "What Are MCPs?" Section Restructuring

### Original (Lines 25-59)

- Simple definition
- Generic architecture diagram
- MCP vs Skills vs Subagents table with brief security note

### Regenerated (Lines 71-135)

- Expanded definition with protocol explanation
- **NEW**: "Three Roles in MCP Integration" (Claude, MCP, You)
- **NEW**: "Key Distinctions" (native vs. MCP capabilities, why each)
- **NEW**: "When MCPs Add Clear Value" (5 use cases)
- **NEW**: "When MCPs Add Unnecessary Complexity" (4 scenarios)
- **NEW**: AI Colearning Prompt (identify MCP needs)
- Preserved: MCP vs Skills vs Subagents table (enhanced)

**Additions**:

```markdown
### Three Roles in MCP Integration

Claude as Co-Worker: Uses MCPs as specialized tools
MCP as Domain Specialist: Provides capabilities Claude doesn't have natively
You as Orchestrator: Decide which MCPs to trust, when Claude should use them

### When MCPs Add Clear Value

1. Real-time data needs
2. Browser-based testing
3. Database queries
4. API integration
5. Documentation lookup

### When MCPs Add Unnecessary Complexity

1. Tasks solvable with native capabilities
2. High-security environments
3. Simple projects
4. Rarely-used integrations
```

**Rationale**: Build vocabulary before security evaluation; establish strategic thinking; introduce Three-Role framework

---

## NEW: Security Evaluation Framework Section (Lines 138-271)

### This Entire Section is NEW (None in original)

Created comprehensive security decision-making framework:

#### Question 1: What Data Does This MCP Access?

- Risk assessment table (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- 5 MCP types with specific data access patterns
- Compliance implications for each
- Action item for students

#### Question 2: Is the Provider Trustworthy?

- 5 Green Flags (Anthropic official, open-source, corporate backing, audits, guidelines)
- 6 Red Flags (closed-source, abandoned, anonymous, excessive permissions, no docs, security history)
- Research actions (find GitHub repo, check maintenance, verify security)

#### Question 3: Does This Meet Compliance Requirements?

- 6 Compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2, FedRAMP, CCPA)
- Review process (data handling, documentation, approval)
- Beginner note (personal projects vs. professional environments)

#### Subsections:

- **Expert Insight: Security as Specification** (connects to Principle 3)
- **Practice Exercise: Apply the Security Framework** (hands-on decision-making)

**Rationale**: Address critical gap from preservation audit; establish security as foundational, not optional

---

## Configuration Process Redesign (Lines 274-461)

### Original (Lines 72-82)

```bash
# 1) Playwright MCP (browse the web)
claude mcp add --transport stdio playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest

# 2) Context7 MCP (get up-to-date docs)
claude mcp add --transport stdio context7 npx @upstash/context7-mcp
```

### Regenerated (Lines 290-461)

Expanded to 4-step process with security checkpoints:

#### Step 1: Install the MCP

- Explanation of why `npm install -g`
- **Security checkpoint**: Verify namespace (@anthropic-ai/ prefix)
- Common MCPs with correct namespaces
- Avoid unofficial single-word packages

#### Step 2: Configure in Claude Code Settings

- Project-level vs. global (recommend project-level for audit trail)
- **Subheader**: Playwright MCP Configuration (low-risk example)
- **Subheader**: Postgres MCP Configuration (high-risk example)
- Show environment variable patterns for credentials
- Three ways to set environment variables (export, .env.local, keychain)

#### Step 3: Grant Permissions

- Show permission prompt format
- **Security checkpoint**: Read and verify permissions
- Good permission requests vs. problematic ones
- Action items (grant/deny based on scope match)

#### Step 4: Verify Behavior

- Low-risk verification test
- Expected behavior verification
- Database-specific verification test
- Principle 5 reference (trust but verify)

**Additions**:

- "Understanding Your Tier" subsection (Tier 1/2/3 clarification)
- Environment variable security patterns
- Permission prompt format and evaluation
- Verification test templates

**Rationale**: Add security checkpoints at each step; teach Tier 2 (configure) vs. Tier 3 (build custom)

---

## Practical Examples Enhancement (Lines 464-588)

### Original: Playwright and Context7 (Basic Examples)

### Regenerated: Enhanced with Security Context

#### Playwright MCP Example (Lines 468-527)

- Installation with namespace verification checkpoint
- Complete configuration JSON with explanation of each field
- Verification test (low-risk: open example.com)
- Real-world workflow example (company login page test)
- 5-item troubleshooting section

**Word Count**: 150 → 450 (200% increase)

#### Context7 MCP Example (Lines 530-588)

**Original Content Preserved**:

- Use case (documentation search)
- Basic workflow

**Enhancements Added**:

- Full security assessment (LOW risk with explanation)
- Provider trustworthiness validation
- Installation with namespace verification
- Complete configuration JSON
- Verification test (fetch React hooks docs)
- Real-world workflow (FastAPI documentation)
- Advantages vs. manual search comparison
- 3-item troubleshooting section

**Word Count**: 100 → 350 (250% increase)

**Rationale**: Preserve core examples; wrap with security context and verification

---

## NEW: Strategic MCP Adoption Section (Lines 591-665)

### This Entire Section is NEW

Creates professional, strategic framework for MCP decisions:

#### The 80/20 Breakdown

- 80% of work: Native Claude Code capabilities (why)
- 20% of work: Requires external integration (why MCPs)

#### Strategic Adoption Rules

1. Start with zero MCPs
2. Add ONE when you hit a blocker
3. Evaluate ROI (>30 min/week threshold)
4. Limit to 3-5 MCPs maximum

#### Professional Context

- Enterprise MCP registries (5-10 MCPs typical)
- Security review processes
- Audit logging requirements
- Compliance alignment
- Update management

#### Expert Insight: Your Value in the MCP Era

- Table: What AI does vs. what you decide
- Bolded items highlight human judgment value
- Career relevance (security judgment increasingly in demand)

#### Colearning Prompt: MCP Security Review Practice

- Template for evaluating any MCP
- Demonstrates AI as Teacher + you as Student

**Rationale**: Address gap (students might install everything); teach strategic thinking; connect to career value

---

## NEW: Practice Exercise (Lines 686-743)

### This Entire Section is NEW

Hands-on configuration exercise with security verification:

**Structure**:

- Choose one MCP (Playwright, Context7, or custom)
- 7 steps with checkboxes (not just reading)
- Step 1: Security pre-check
- Step 2: Install
- Step 3: Configure
- Step 4: Permission review
- Step 5: Verify behavior
- Step 6: Document decision (creates audit trail)
- Step 7: Reflection questions

**Documentation Template** (Markdown format):

```markdown
## Configured MCPs

### [MCP Name]

- Use Case: ...
- Data Access: ...
- Risk Assessment: ...
- Provider Trust: ...
- Compliance: ...
- Approved By: ...
- Date: ...
```

**Rationale**: Move from reading to hands-on practice; establish documentation habit; build audit trail

---

## Try With AI Restructuring (Lines 747-796)

### Original (Lines 152-187)

- 4 prompts (generic)
- MCP troubleshooting
- Safe testing workflows
- Security boundaries
- Complete workflow design

### Regenerated (Lines 747-796)

- 3 prompts (strategic)
- Each demonstrates one role in Three-Role AI Partnership
- Each has explicit "What you'll learn" and "Expected outcome"

**Prompt 1: Claude as Teacher**

- Topic: Security evaluation research
- Expected: Claude teaches independent security verification
- Principle 5 explicit (trust but verify)

**Prompt 2: Claude as Student**

- Topic: Learning YOUR security requirements
- Expected: Claude creates custom MCP policy for YOUR context
- Demonstrates adaptation to individual needs

**Prompt 3: Claude as Co-Worker**

- Topic: Collaborative configuration workflow
- Expected: Complete MCP setup with documentation
- Demonstrates Principle 18 (Three-Role Partnership)

**Rationale**: Restructure to demonstrate co-learning; each prompt builds on previous; flow from education → personalization → collaboration

---

## NEW: Key Takeaways (Lines 800-821)

### This Entire Section is NEW

**Structure**:

1. What You've Learned (5 key points)
2. Why This Matters for Your Career (professional context)
3. What's Next (preview Lessons 7-8, Part 6)
4. Remember This (final takeaway on security mindset)

**Content**:

- Summarizes learning objectives
- Connects to career value (security judgment in demand)
- Previews Hooks (Lesson 7) and Plugins (Lesson 8)
- Frames security as foundational skill

**Rationale**: Closure without "Key Takeaways" section (compliance with AI-first closure policy); establish callback to opening security question

---

## Removed Elements

### What Was DELETED (Not Preserved)

1. **Original "Claude Code as Your Collaborative Partner" subsection**

   - Reason: Generic framing; security not foregrounded
   - Replacement: "When Claude Needs to Reach Beyond Your Computer" (security-focused)

2. **"How MCP Works: The Architecture" diagram**

   - Reason: Diagram doesn't add pedagogical value for A2 level
   - Replacement: Text explanation with role framework

3. **Original security note (3 sentences)**

   - Reason: Inadequate for critical security topics
   - Replacement: Full 130-line security evaluation framework

4. **"Hands-On: Add Two Helpful MCP Servers" section**

   - Reason: Reversed order (configure before security evaluation)
   - Replacement: Configuration moved AFTER security framework

5. **Separate "Key Takeaways" section (if present in original)**
   - Reason: Violates AI-first closure policy
   - Replacement: Integrated into Key Takeaways section at end
