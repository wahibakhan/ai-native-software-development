## For Technical Reviewer (10-15 min)

### 1. Constitutional Alignment Verification

**Principle 18 Check** (Three-Role AI Partnership):

- [ ] Insertion 1 (Lines 24-26): AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker explicit?

  - "suggesting standards" ✅
  - "learning preferences" ✅
  - "executing reviews" ✅
  - "role clarity in action" ✅

- [ ] Insertion 3 (Lines 203-205): Role clarity in delegation modes?
  - Explicit delegation: "actively directing role" ✅
  - Automatic delegation: "role flexibility" ✅
  - Neither passive ✅

**Status**: Three-Role framework **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

**Principle 13 Check** (Graduated Teaching Pattern):

- [ ] Insertion 5 (Lines 132-147): Spec-first thinking present?
  - "clarity first, implementation second" ✅
  - Planning questions before building ✅
  - Example specification provided ✅
  - Leads to creation walkthrough ✅

**Status**: Graduated teaching **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

**"Specs Are the New Syntax" Check**:

- [ ] Specification-writing emphasized as primary skill?
- [ ] Insertion 5: "Practice specification thinking" explicit?
- [ ] Example spec format provided?
- [ ] Students write spec BEFORE implementation?

**Status**: Spec-first emphasis **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 2. Subagent Mechanics Verification

**Claude Code Documentation**:

- [ ] Subagent creation steps (Lines 155-164) match current Claude Code docs?
- [ ] Delegation modes explanation (Lines 194-199) technically accurate?
- [ ] File structure (`.claude/agents/`) correct?
- [ ] Best practices (Lines 224-239) align with conventions?

**If any mismatch**: Document version/date of Claude Code docs used

**Status**: Technical accuracy **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 3. Domain-Agnostic Prompt Testing

**Insertion 2 (AI Colearning Prompt)**:

Test prompt across domains. Students should be able to customize:

- [ ] Web app developer: "web app, API design vs. bug fixes" ✅
- [ ] Data engineer: "data pipeline, ETL logic vs. validation" ✅
- [ ] DevOps engineer: "infrastructure, deploy scripts vs. config" ✅
- [ ] Mobile developer: "mobile app, UI components vs. backend" ✅

**Test**: Does prompt work when you substitute [describe your domain]?

**Status**: Domain-agnostic functionality **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 4. Integration with Lesson 1

- [ ] Insertion 1 explicitly references "Remember from Lesson 1"?
- [ ] Three-Role AI Partnership framework correctly represented?
- [ ] No contradictions with Lesson 1 concepts?

**Status**: Lesson 1 integration **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

## For Proof Validator (10-15 min)

### 1. Tone & Voice Consistency

Read through insertions for voice consistency:

- [ ] Insertion 1: Encouraging, connects prior learning ✅
- [ ] Insertion 2: Invitational, personalized ("your context") ✅
- [ ] Insertion 3: Clarifying, authoritative but accessible ✅
- [ ] Insertion 4: Strategic, motivating ✅
- [ ] Insertion 5: Supportive, directive ✅
- [ ] Insertion 6: Procedural, reflective ✅

**Test**: Do insertions feel like same author as original content?

**Status**: Tone consistency **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 2. Reading Level Verification

Sample sentences from insertions (estimate Flesch-Kincaid):

**Insertion 1** (Line 26):

```
"When you delegate a code review explicitly to a specialized subagent,
you're practicing the co-learning partnership at its best: you set the
intention, AI brings focused expertise, and together you achieve better
results than either could alone."
```

Expected level: 7-8 **\_\_\_** Actual: **\_\_\_**

**Insertion 5** (Line 134):

```
"Before jumping to creation, let's practice specification thinking—
planning your subagent's purpose before you build it."
```

Expected level: 6-7 **\_\_\_** Actual: **\_\_\_**

**Overall Assessment**: Target 7.2 (Grade 7) **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 3. Natural Integration Test

Read each insertion in context (5 lines before + insertion + 5 lines after):

- [ ] Insertion 1: Flows from intro to "What Are Subagents?" naturally?
- [ ] Insertion 2: Flows from key insight table to benefits section?
- [ ] Insertion 3: Flows after delegation explanation to verification?
- [ ] Insertion 4: Flows from best practices to reflection section?
- [ ] Insertion 5: Flows before creation walkthrough naturally?
- [ ] Insertion 6: Flows after walkthrough to formal section naturally?

**Test**: Do you notice insertions feel "bolted on" or like they were always there?

**Status**: Natural flow **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 4. No Unintended Repetition

Check for content duplication:

- [ ] No repetition of context pollution explanation?
- [ ] No duplication of subagent benefits?
- [ ] No redundant delegation mode explanation?
- [ ] No over-explanation of Three-Role framework?

**Status**: No unwanted repetition **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 5. Try With AI Section Integrity

- [ ] Section unchanged (lines 258-291)?
- [ ] No post-sections added ("Key Takeaways", "Summary", "What's Next")?
- [ ] Section ends lesson appropriately?

**Status**: Closure pattern maintained **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

## For Publication Gate (5-10 min)

### 1. File Integrity

- [ ] File written to correct path?

  ```
  /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/part-2/
  apps/learn-app/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/
  05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/
  04-subagents.md
  ```

- [ ] YAML frontmatter intact (lines 1-4)?
- [ ] All markdown valid (no broken formatting)?
- [ ] All headings properly leveled (no H5 or skip levels)?
- [ ] No accidental characters or encoding issues?

**Status**: File integrity **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 2. Docusaurus Build Test

```bash
cd book-source
npm run build
```

Check for:

- [ ] No build errors related to 04-subagents.md?
- [ ] Markdown rendering correct (tables, lists, blockquotes)?
- [ ] Links working (if any added)?
- [ ] Sidebar navigation correct?

**Status**: Build success **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 3. Cross-Reference Validation

Check links to adjacent lessons:

- [ ] Lesson 1 (Three-Role framework) still exists and accessible?
- [ ] Lesson 5 (if exists) not disrupted by this insertion?
- [ ] Chapter 5 overview still valid?
- [ ] Part 2 context not broken?

**Status**: Cross-references valid **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]

---

### 4. Adjacent Lesson Context

Compare with:

- [ ] Lesson 3 (Claude Code Basics): Consistent terminology?
- [ ] Lesson 5 (next): No duplication, proper progression?

Does this lesson serve as natural bridge from Lesson 3 to Lesson 5?

**Status**: Chapter flow intact **\_\_\_** [PASS/FAIL]
