### 2. Opening Introduction (REGENERATED)

**Original (Lines 9-26, Original File)**:

```markdown
## The Problem: Repetitive Manual Checks

Claude Code finishes editing your code. You manually check:
```

Claude edits: app.py
↓ (manual) Run linter
↓ (manual) Check types
↓ (manual) Run tests

```

**Repetitive. Every time.**

**What if Claude Code automatically ran these checks?**

That's what **hooks** do. Hooks intercept actions and run automation **before** or **after** them.
```

**Regenerated (Lines 28-43, New File)**:

```markdown
## Your Tedious Tasks: The Automation Starting Point

Think about your typical development workflow. What do you check manually **every single time**?

- Before you commit code: _"Did I run the linter? Did I run tests? Are there console warnings?"_
- After you edit a file: _"This needs formatting. I need to check types."_
- When you start a project session: _"Let me check the git branch, verify dependencies are installed."_
- Before Claude makes changes: _"I should verify this is safe—no deleting important files."_

**These repetitive checks are tedious.** You know what to check. You know the order. You do it dozens of times a day. But every time, you do it manually.

**What if Claude Code proactively handled these checks?**

That's exactly what **hooks** do. In this lesson, you'll learn to specify automation rules once, and Claude Code enforces them automatically—forever. This is **Specification-Driven Automation** (Constitution Principle 3): You articulate the automation pattern (the "what" and "when"), Claude handles execution (the "how").

**Strategic value:** Hooks transform your AI Co-Worker from passive executor to proactive partner. You delegate routine validation to AI, freeing your attention for high-value decisions. This is Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Pattern), Tier 2: You specify the quality gates once, Claude enforces them forever.
```

**Changes**:

- Title: "The Problem" → "Your Tedious Tasks: The Automation Starting Point" (personalization)
- Approach: Generic problem → Personal pain point ("YOUR checks", "YOUR workflow")
- Added: Strategic value framing (delegation, AI Co-Worker, Tier 2)
- Added: Constitutional references (Principle 3, Principle 13)
- Added: Clear thesis statement (specification-driven automation)
- Tone: Empathetic, personal, strategic (vs. problem-centric)

**Rationale**:

- Personalizes content ("Your tedious tasks" > "The problem")
- Establishes hooks as specifications (Principle 3)
- Introduces Tier 2 delegation concept early (Principle 13)
- Sets strategic context (not just technical mechanics)

---

### 3. NEW SECTION: Automation Thinking Pattern

**Lines**: 47-111
**Status**: NEW (entire section added, not in original)
**Content**:

```markdown
## Automation Thinking Pattern: Tedious → Hook Type → Matcher → Action

Before diving into hook types, let's learn to think in **automation patterns**. This four-step framework transforms any tedious task into a hook specification.

### Step 1: Identify Tedious

[8 examples of tedious tasks]
**Key insight:** Anything you do repeatedly without thinking = candidate for automation.

### Step 2: Choose Hook Type (WHEN)

[Table: 4 hook types with when/best for]
**Examples matching task to hook type**

### Step 3: Define Matcher (WHAT triggers specifically)

[Matcher options: single, multiple, wildcard, subcommands]
**Examples of matcher logic**

### Step 4: Specify Action (DO WHAT)

[4 action types: command, block, warn, enrich]
**Examples for each action type**
```

**Rationale**:

- Teaches HOW to think in automation patterns (Automation Thinking Pattern)
- Frames hooks as specifications (4-step: Intent → Type → Trigger → Action)
- Domain-agnostic (applies to any hook task)
- Actionable (students can immediately apply to their workflow)
- Introduces matcher/action concepts before detailed implementation sections

---

### 4. NEW SECTION: 💬 AI Colearning Prompt 1

**Lines**: 114-121
**Status**: NEW (entire section added)
**Content**:

```markdown
## 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: Identify YOUR Automation Opportunities

You've learned the pattern. Now let AI help YOU identify opportunities in YOUR workflow.

> **Explore with your AI:**
> "I work on [your domain: web apps, data pipelines, DevOps, mobile, etc.]. Analyze my typical development workflow and suggest 3 automation opportunities where hooks would save me time or catch errors. For each suggestion: (1) What tedious task it automates, (2) Which hook type to use (SessionStart/PreToolUse/PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit), (3) What command/action the hook would execute, (4) Estimated time saved or errors prevented per day."

**What you'll learn:** AI will likely identify automation opportunities YOU hadn't considered. This is Principle 18 (Three Roles), AI as Teacher: AI suggests patterns (type checking validation, security scanning) based on domain expertise.
```

**Rationale**:

- CoLearning element (AI as Teacher suggesting domain-specific patterns)
- Personalizes content ("YOUR domain", "YOUR workflow")
- Demonstrates Three-Role AI Partnership (Principle 18)
- Domain-agnostic prompt (works for any tech stack)

---

### 5. Hook Types Section (ENHANCED)

**Original (Lines 28-46, Original File)**:

```markdown
## What Are Hooks?

**Definition**: A hook is an automation trigger that runs before or after Claude Code executes a tool.
[2 examples: simple version and example flow]
```

**Regenerated (Lines 125-193, New File)**:

**New Structure**:

- Removed old "What Are Hooks?" section
- Replaced with detailed hook type breakdown
- Added "Strategic Use Case" subheading to each hook type
- Hook type definitions PRESERVED (no content change)
- Added contextual explanation for WHEN/WHY each hook matters

**Example Change (SessionStart)**:

Original (implied):

```
SessionStart: Runs when Claude Code starts
```

Regenerated:

```markdown
### SessionStart — Environment Health Checks

**Fires:** When Claude Code starts

**Strategic Use Case:** Use SessionStart for environment validation. Examples:

- Verify you're on the correct git branch (prevents working in wrong context)
- Check that required tools are installed
- Confirm environment variables are set
- Test database connections
- Show project status summary

**Why this matters:** A 3-second environment check at session start prevents 30 minutes of wasted work later.
```

**Changes for Each Hook Type**:

- PreToolUse: Added "Safety & Prevention" framing, "Why this matters" (damage prevention value)
- PostToolUse: Added "Validation & Follow-Up" framing, "Why this matters" (consistency and standards)
- UserPromptSubmit: Added "Context Enrichment & Logging" framing, "Why this matters" (response quality)
- Advanced Events: Added note that these are Tier 3 (optional)

**Rationale**:

- Explains not just WHAT each hook does, but WHEN/WHY it matters
- Emphasizes strategic value (prevents mistakes, ensures quality)
- Makes hook type selection intuitive (student can match their task to hook type)
- Adds no content change to definitions (preservation maintained)

---

### 6. NEW SECTION: 🎓 Expert Insight 1

**Lines**: 197-224
**Status**: NEW (entire section added)
**Content**:

```markdown
## 🎓 Expert Insight: Strategic Delegation to Your AI Co-Worker

Hooks demonstrate the **Three-Role AI Partnership** in action:

**AI as Co-Worker (Proactive Partner):**
[explains AI proactively enforces hooks without needing to be asked]

**Tier 2 Strategic Delegation (Constitution Principle 13):**
[explains Tier 1 learned, Tier 2 lesson focus, Tier 3 optional]

**Compounding Effect:**
[1-2 hooks useful → 5-10 powerful → 20+ competitive advantage]

**Organizational Value:**
[hooks as organizational standards, team adoption]
```

**Rationale**:

- Demonstrates Three-Role AI Partnership (Principle 18)
- Explains Tier 2 in context (student understands where they are in learning progression)
- Emphasizes organizational value (hooks as team standards, competitive advantage)
- Frames hooks as strategic assets (Specs as Strategic Assets concept)

---

### 7. Step 0: 🤝 Practice Exercise 1 (Design Your First Hook)

**Lines**: 228-266
**Status**: NEW (moved earlier than implementation, added "Specification-First" emphasis)
**Original Location**: Was at end as "Exercise 1" (lines 478-495 in original)
**Content Changes**:

Original (at end):

```markdown
### Exercise 1: Write Your First Hook (Foundation)

**Steps**:

1. Create `.claude/settings.json` in your project...
   [immediate implementation instructions]
```

Regenerated (before implementation):

```markdown
## 🤝 Practice Exercise 1: Design Your First Hook (Specification-First)

Before building, specify. This is the Graduated Teaching Pattern: you'll plan your automation before writing code.

**Choose ONE tedious task** from your workflow:
[examples of tasks]

**Apply the Automation Thinking Pattern:**

1. **Tedious Task**: Describe what you check manually and how often
2. **Hook Type**: Which fits best? (with reasoning)
3. **Matcher**: What triggers specifically?
4. **Action**: What command runs?
5. **Write 3-5 sentences** describing your hook specification (not code yet—just intent)
6. **ROI Check**: Is this worth >5 minutes saved per day?

**Example Specification:**
[shows specification BEFORE code example]
```

**Changes**:

- Moved from "Try With AI" exercises to main lesson flow
- Added "Specification-First" emphasis (plan before code)
- Restructured as explicit specification writing exercise
- Added ROI check (students evaluate value before implementation)
- Removed "write JSON immediately" approach
- Added example specification (shows intent before code)

**Rationale**:

- Teaches Specification-First Development (Principle 3)
- Implements Graduated Teaching Pattern (plan Tier 2 before executing Tier 2)
- Reduces cognitive load (plan separately from implementation)
- Increases success (students clarify intent before code)

---

### 8. Steps 1-3: Hook Creation Approaches (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 270-406
**Status**: PRESERVED (technical content unchanged, added context)

**What Was Preserved**:

- Step 1: Create `.claude/settings.json` (lines 274-357) — 100% unchanged
- Step 2: Use `/hooks` command (lines 360-381) — 100% unchanged
- Step 3: AI-native configuration (lines 385-406) — 100% unchanged

**What Was Enhanced**:

- Added context before Step 1: "You'll write JSON directly so you understand exactly how hooks work."
- Added explanation after testing: "Why write it manually?" and "What you learned: Hooks are specifications..."
- Added context after Step 3: "Why this works: Claude reads the official docs in real-time... This is how AI serves Tier 2"

**Rationale**: Preserves technical content while adding strategic context and pedagogical framing.

---

### 9. Permissions Section (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 410-457
**Status**: PRESERVED (100% unchanged from original)
**Location**: Same position, same content
**Changes**: None to content, placed immediately after Step 3

---

### 10. Hook Events Table (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 461-475
**Status**: PRESERVED (100% unchanged)
**Changes**: None

---

### 11. Matchers Documentation (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 479-603
**Status**: PRESERVED (100% unchanged)
**Changes**: None
**Content**:

- Option 1: Single tool
- Option 2: Multiple tools (pipe notation)
- Option 3: Wildcard
- Example with different messages

---

### 12. Scope: Project vs Global (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 606-624
**Status**: PRESERVED (100% unchanged)

---

### 13. Strategic Hook Management (ENHANCED)

**Original (Lines 405-472, Original File)**:

```markdown
## Common Hook Patterns

### Pattern 1: Friendly Greeting

[JSON example]

### Pattern 2: Action Confirmations

[JSON examples]

### Pattern 3: Pre-Action Warnings

[JSON examples]
```

**Regenerated (Lines 628-758, New File)**:

**Section Expansion**:

- Renamed: "Common Hook Patterns" → "Strategic Hook Management (Best Practices)"
- Added opening frame: "Hooks are organizational assets—treat them like code"
- Added 5 subsections with "Why this matters" explanations:
  1. Start With Simple Hooks
  2. Document Why Each Hook Exists
  3. Test Hooks Individually
  4. Version Control Your Hooks
  5. Gradual Rollout for Team Hooks
- Preserved original 3 hook patterns as reference (lines 694-758)

**New Subsections Added**:

**"Start With Simple Hooks"**:

```markdown
Create basic hooks first (single matcher, single action). Examples:

- SessionStart hook checking git branch
- PostToolUse + Edit hook running linter
- PreToolUse + Bash hook warning before deletes

**Why this matters**: Simple hooks have high ROI (easy to debug, obvious value). Build confidence before complexity.
```

**"Document Why Each Hook Exists"**:

```markdown
Add comments to `.claude/settings.json`:
[JSON example with WHY comments]

**Why this matters**: Future you (and your team) will understand intent, not just mechanics.
```

**"Test Hooks Individually"**:

```markdown
When creating a hook:

1. Create it
2. Trigger the event...
3. Verify the hook executed
4. Check the output

**Why this matters**: Caught-early bugs are cheap. Late-stage hook bugs are expensive.
```

**"Version Control Your Hooks"**:

```markdown
`.claude/settings.json` belongs in git:
[git commands]

**Why this matters**: Hooks are team standards. Version control makes changes transparent and reversible.
```

**"Gradual Rollout for Team Hooks"**:

```markdown
Don't add 10 hooks at once. Instead:

1. Add 1-2 hooks per week
2. Gather feedback...
3. Refine based on usage
4. Only then add more

**Why this matters**: Hooks change behavior. Gradual adoption allows teams to adapt.
```

**Rationale**:

- Elevates "patterns" to "strategic management" (organizational perspective)
- Adds practical wisdom (documentation, testing, version control, team adoption)
- "Why this matters" explanations build understanding (not just mechanics)
- Emphasizes organizational value throughout

---

### 14. Common Hook Patterns (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 694-758
**Status**: PRESERVED (100% unchanged)
**Content**:

- Pattern 1: Friendly Greeting
- Pattern 2: Action Confirmations
- Pattern 3: Pre-Action Warnings

---

### 15. Troubleshooting (PRESERVED)

**Lines**: 762-825
**Status**: PRESERVED (100% unchanged)
**Content**:

- Hook Not Executing? (Check 1-4)
- Hook Causing Issues?
- Permission Denied Errors?
- Platform-Specific Issues

---

### 16. NEW SECTION: 🤝 Practice Exercise 2

**Lines**: 829-869
**Status**: NEW (entire section added as distinct from Exercise 1)
**Content**:

```markdown
## 🤝 Practice Exercise 2: Create and Test Your First Hook

Now implement the hook you designed in Practice Exercise 1.

**Steps:**

1. Open/Create `.claude/settings.json`...
2. Add your hook to appropriate section...
3. Ensure tool is in `permissions.allow`...
4. Save the file
5. Test the trigger...
6. Observe the output...
7. Iterate if needed...
8. Reflect...

**Expected Outcome**: One working hook that automatically handles your tedious task.
```

**Rationale**:

- Separates Exercise 1 (specification) from Exercise 2 (implementation)
- Implements Graduated Teaching: plan → implement → test → reflect
- Adds reflection prompts (what did you learn?)
- Shows clear progression (specification before implementation)

---

### 17. NEW SECTION: 💬 AI Colearning Prompt 2

**Lines**: 873-884
**Status**: NEW (entire section added)
**Content**:

```markdown
## 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: Strategic Hook Library Design

Now think beyond individual hooks. AI can help you design a complete hook library for your team.

> **Plan with your AI:**
> "My team's common pain points are [list 3-5 tedious or error-prone tasks...]. Design a hook library (5-7 hooks) that would address these pain points. For each hook in the library: (1) Hook name and type, (2) What manual task it replaces, (3) Matcher criteria (which tool), (4) Exact action/command, (5) Estimated time/frustration saved per week. Also suggest rollout order (which hooks first, which later)."

**What you'll learn:**

- AI will help you see patterns (most teams have similar pain points)
- You'll discover hooks you hadn't thought of...
- You'll learn prioritization...
- This is Principle 18 (Three Roles): AI as Teacher suggesting best practices, AI as Co-Worker helping you design systems
```

**Rationale**:

- Team-focused (library design, organizational standards)
- Strategic planning (prioritization, rollout order)
- Demonstrates Two-Role partnership (Teacher + Co-Worker)
- Introduces "Specs as Strategic Assets" concept

---

### 18. Try With AI Section (REGENERATED)

**Original (Lines 474-526, Original File)**:

```markdown
## Try With AI

Practice all three approaches: manual, interactive, and AI-native.

### Exercise 1: Write Your First Hook (Foundation)

### Exercise 2: Use the Interactive Way

### Exercise 3: AI-Native Configuration
```

**Regenerated (Lines 888-994, New File)**:

**New Structure**:

- Renamed from generic "Try With AI" to focused "Try With AI" (role-based)
- 3 exercises, each demonstrating ONE role:
  1. **Claude as Teacher** — Hook Opportunities (AI Suggests)
  2. **Claude as Student** — Learning YOUR Workflow (AI Adapts)
  3. **Claude as Co-Worker** — Build and Deploy Your Hook

**Exercise 1: Claude as Teacher**

Original approach:

```
Write your first hook manually following these steps...
```

Regenerated approach:

```markdown
### Exercise 1: Claude as Teacher — Hook Opportunities (AI Suggests)

**Prompt to Claude:**
```

Analyze my development workflow. I primarily work on [Python/JavaScript/other],
my projects are [type: web apps/data pipelines/CLI tools/etc], and I'm concerned about
[performance/security/reliability/consistency/testing]. Using that context, identify
3-4 automation opportunities where hooks would improve my workflow. For each:
(1) What problem it solves, (2) Recommended hook type and matcher,
(3) Exact command/action to implement, (4) How to test it works.

```

**What Claude generates:**
- Domain-specific hook recommendations (AI knows your tech stack)
- Practical matchers and commands (tested patterns)
- Testing strategies (how to verify hooks work)

**Your role:** Evaluate suggestions. Which hooks matter most to you? Which do you want to implement first?
```

**Changes**:

- Explicit role demonstration (Claude as Teacher, not just "AI suggests")
- Domain-specific context in prompt ("your domain", "your concerns")
- Clear output expectations ("What Claude generates")
- Clear student role ("Your role")

**Exercise 2: Claude as Student** (ENTIRELY NEW)

```markdown
### Exercise 2: Claude as Student — Learning YOUR Workflow (AI Adapts)

**Prompt to Claude:**
```

Interview me about my development workflow so you can recommend custom hooks.
Ask me: (1) What do I check manually most often before/after actions?
(2) What errors have I made repeatedly that automation could prevent?
(3) What frustrates me most about my current process?
(4) What tools/languages do I use most?

Based on my answers, design 2-3 custom hooks specifically for my workflow.

```

**What Claude does:**
- Asks clarifying questions (Claude as Student, learning your context)
- Listens to your answers (adapts understanding)
- Designs custom hooks based on YOUR specific needs (not generic patterns)

**Your role:** Answer questions authentically. Claude learns your workflow and tailors recommendations. This is Principle 18: AI as Student, learning from your domain expertise.
```

**Rationale**:

- Demonstrates "AI as Student" role (asks questions, listens, adapts)
- Emphasizes personalization (custom hooks for YOUR workflow)
- Shows bidirectional learning (you teach AI about your domain)
- Implements Principle 18 (Three Roles Framework)

**Exercise 3: Claude as Co-Worker** (ENTIRELY NEW)

```markdown
### Exercise 3: Claude as Co-Worker — Build and Deploy Your Hook

**Prompt to Claude:**
```

I want to create a hook that [describe your automation goal: runs tests before commits,
checks for hardcoded secrets, formats code after edits, validates branch before pushes,
verifies deployment readiness, etc.]. Help me:
(1) Choose the right hook type and matcher for this goal
(2) Write the exact hook JSON configuration
(3) Specify the correct permissions needed in .claude/settings.json
(4) Create a testing plan to verify it works
(5) Troubleshoot if something doesn't work as expected

```

**What Claude does:**
- Collaborates on implementation (not just tells you what to do)
- Generates correct JSON configuration
- Handles complexity (you focus on intent, Claude handles syntax)

**Your role:** Specify intent, validate Claude's implementation, run tests, adjust if needed. This is Principle 18: AI as Co-Worker, handling tactical execution while you manage strategy.
```

**Rationale**:

- Demonstrates "AI as Co-Worker" role (collaborates, handles complexity)
- Shows task division (you: intent/strategy, AI: syntax/complexity)
- Implements Principle 18 (Three Roles Framework)
- Practical and actionable (students can run this immediately)

---

### 19. Closing Section (REGENERATED)

**Original (Lines 529-540, Original File)**:

```markdown
## What's Next

You now understand **the automation foundation**:

- ✅ SessionStart — When Claude Code starts
- ✅ PreToolUse — Before actions execute
- ✅ PostToolUse — After actions complete

**In Lesson 8**, you'll see how **plugins package hooks together**...
```

**Regenerated (Lines 956-994, New File)**:

**New Closing Structure**:

```markdown
## Closing: Automation as Strategic Asset

You've learned hooks—specifications that trigger automation.

**Key takeaways:**

- **Hooks = Specifications**: You specify (once) when/what/how to automate. Claude enforces (forever).
- **Automation Thinking Pattern**: Tedious → Hook Type → Matcher → Action. Apply this to any repetitive task.
- **Tier 2 Delegation**: Hooks represent Graduated Teaching Pattern (Tier 2): you specify quality gates, AI enforces them.
- **Strategic Value**: Each hook saves time. 5-10 hooks = quality layer your team uses unconsciously.
- **Compounding Effect**: Individual hooks seem small, but together they encode organizational standards.

**What hooks represent in Constitution Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching):**

- **Tier 1** (Book teaches): Understanding hook types, automation patterns
- **Tier 2** (AI Companion): Creating and configuring hooks ← **You did this**
- **Tier 3** (AI Orchestration): Complex multi-hook systems managing entire workflows (optional, advanced)

You've mastered Tier 2. Tier 3 (orchestrating 20+ hooks across team) is optional—available when you need it.

---

## Try With AI

Pick one exercise and start now:

**Option 1: Discovery** (Easy start)

- Run Exercise 1: Ask Claude to identify 3 automation opportunities in YOUR workflow

**Option 2: Custom Design** (Deeper learning)

- Run Exercise 2: Have Claude interview you, then design custom hooks

**Option 3: Implementation** (Hands-on)

- Run Exercise 3: Build your first hook with Claude's help, then test it

**Expected outcomes:**

- Exercise 1: 3 concrete hook ideas you can implement (or not—it's your choice)
- Exercise 2: Deep understanding of YOUR automation opportunities
- Exercise 3: One working hook + confidence to build more

Pick whichever sounds most valuable to you right now. Start with what interests you most.
```

**Changes**:

- Renamed: "What's Next" → "Closing: Automation as Strategic Asset" (thematic closure)
- Added: Key takeaways (reinforces learning)
- Added: Tier 1/2/3 context (student understands learning progression)
- Removed: Forward reference to Lesson 8 (breaks closure pattern)
- Added: "Pick one exercise and start now" (choice, autonomy, agency)
- Kept: "Try With AI" as final action (consistent with lesson closure pattern)
- NOTE: **No "What's Next" section after Try With AI** (adheres to project policy)

**Rationale**:

- Thematic closure (automation as strategic asset) instead of navigation
- Reinforces key concepts without separate "Key Takeaways" section
- Contextualizes learning (shows where student is in Tier progression)
- Provides choice and agency (student picks which exercise to start with)
- Ends with action-oriented closing (not "see you next chapter")
- Maintains project policy: single "Try With AI" closure, no post-sections
