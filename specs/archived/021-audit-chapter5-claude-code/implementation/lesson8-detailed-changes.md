## Change 1: Extension Hierarchy Visualization

**Type**: INSERTION (new subsection with visualization)
**Location**: After line 39 (plugin definition list)
**Lines Added**: 41-76 (36 lines)
**Insertion Point**: Between original plugin definition and "Plugins vs. Individual Extensions"

### Before (lines 31-41):

```markdown
## What Are Plugins?

**Definition**: A plugin is a **composable package** that bundles commands, agents, skills, and hooks into a single reusable workflow.

Instead of scattered automations, plugins organize everything needed for a workflow in one place:

- **Commands** — New `/command` interface
- **Agents** — Subagents that execute specialized tasks
- **Skills** — Ambient expertise applied automatically
- **Hooks** — Automation triggers before/after actions

### Plugins vs. Individual Extensions

## What Are Plugins?

**Definition**: A plugin is a **composable package** that bundles commands, agents, skills, and hooks into a single reusable workflow.

Instead of scattered automations, plugins organize everything needed for a workflow in one place:

- **Commands** — New `/command` interface
- **Agents** — Subagents that execute specialized tasks
- **Skills** — Ambient expertise applied automatically
- **Hooks** — Automation triggers before/after actions

### The Extension Hierarchy: How Everything Builds to Plugins

Before diving into plugin details, understand how plugins sit at the peak of an extension hierarchy. Each layer builds on the one before, creating increasingly powerful composition:
```

LEVEL 1: Commands
└─ Single operation (e.g., /commit, /help)
│
└─ LEVEL 2: Subagents
└─ Isolated specialized tasks (e.g., code reviewer, test runner)
│
└─ LEVEL 3: Skills
└─ Ambient expertise applied automatically (e.g., docstring checker)
│
└─ LEVEL 4: Hooks
└─ Event-triggered automation (pre-commit, post-push)
│
└─ LEVEL 5: Plugins
└─ Orchestrates all layers together
(Commands + Subagents + Skills + Hooks)

```

**What This Means:** Each level adds capability:
- **Level 1** (Commands) = Explicit invocation
- **Level 2** (Subagents) = Specialized isolation
- **Level 3** (Skills) = Automatic expertise
- **Level 4** (Hooks) = Event-triggered actions
- **Level 5** (Plugins) = Everything working together seamlessly

**The Composition Power:** A plugin bundles all these together. When you run `/code-review`, you're not running four separate things manually—you're invoking one orchestrated workflow where commands, subagents, skills, and hooks coordinate automatically. This is **Tier 3 orchestration** (from Principle 13): AI manages complexity, you specify intent.

### Plugins vs. Individual Extensions
```

### Rationale

- **Scaffolding**: Visualizes progression from simple (Commands) to complex (Plugins)
- **Accessibility**: ASCII tree is grade 7-8 comprehensible; clear labels
- **Constitutional**: Directly addresses Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Pattern)
- **Cognitive Load**: Introduces 5 concepts (Commands, Subagents, Skills, Hooks, Plugins); at A2 limit

### Constitutional Alignment

- Principle 13 (Tier 3): Shows AI orchestration at peak of extension hierarchy
- Principle 2 (Spec-First): "AI manages complexity, you specify intent"
- Principle 18 (implicit): Framing for upcoming Three-Role discussion

## Change 2: AI Colearning Prompt

**Type**: INSERTION (interactive learning section)
**Location**: After line 76 (hierarchy explanation), within subsection
**Lines Added**: 72-76 (5 lines + heading)
**Insertion Point**: Immediately after hierarchy, before "Plugins vs. Individual Extensions"

### Inserted Content (lines 72-76):

```markdown
#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I work on [describe your typical workflow: feature development, code reviews, deployments, etc.]. Looking at the extension hierarchy above, give me one example where a PLUGIN (orchestrating commands + subagents + skills + hooks) would save me more time than using each extension separately. Show me the before (manual coordination) vs. after (plugin orchestration)."

**What you'll learn:** How plugins transform manual multi-step workflows into single-command automation. Your AI will show you concrete time savings and orchestration patterns you can apply to your own projects.
```

### Context (surrounding content unchanged):

```markdown
**The Composition Power:** A plugin bundles all these together. When you run `/code-review`, you're not running four separate things manually—you're invoking one orchestrated workflow where commands, subagents, skills, and hooks coordinate automatically. This is **Tier 3 orchestration** (from Principle 13): AI manages complexity, you specify intent.

### 🎓 Expert Insight: Plugins as Three-Role AI Partnership at Peak Efficiency

Plugins demonstrate all three roles of AI partnership (from Lesson 1: Three-Role Framework) working together simultaneously:

**AI as Teacher** (Skills Provide Domain Expertise)

- Each plugin's embedded skills teach best practices automatically
- Example: The `code-review` plugin's code-quality skill teaches you secure patterns without you asking
- You learn through observing what the plugin prioritizes and explains

**AI as Student** (Hooks Learn Your Workflow)

- Hooks observe your development patterns and adapt to your workflow
- Pre-commit hooks learn what checks matter most to your team
- The plugin remembers your preferences and applies them consistently

**AI as Co-Worker** (Subagents Execute Complex Tasks)

- Parallel subagents handle specialized work autonomously
- The `pr-review-toolkit` runs 6 different agents simultaneously—work that would take you hours alone
- You don't manage each agent; the plugin orchestrates them

**Peak Efficiency:** Single plugin invocation (e.g., `/code-review`) triggers this entire three-role ecosystem:

1. Hook watches for PR context → fires automatically
2. Command parses your intent → delegates to specialists
3. Subagents execute parallel reviews → each brings expertise
4. Skills apply domain knowledge → specific checks run autonomously
5. Results converge → you get comprehensive feedback

This is **ambient intelligence**—your AI partnership anticipates needs, coordinates specialists, and delivers results without you managing individual components. This is what Tier 3 orchestration (Principle 13) looks like in practice: AI manages complexity at scale, while you focus on strategic direction.

---

## Installing Plugins from Marketplace

````

### Rationale
- **Framework Integration**: Connects plugins to Three-Role Framework taught in Lesson 1
- **Peak Efficiency**: Shows how plugins represent AI partnership at maximum effectiveness
- **Ambient Intelligence**: Introduces aspirational concept (AI anticipates needs)
- **Principle 13**: Explicitly ties to Tier 3 orchestration

### Constitutional Alignment
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Complete breakdown (Teacher/Student/Co-Worker)
- Principle 13 (Tier 3): "What Tier 3 orchestration looks like in practice"
- Principle 2 (Spec-First): "You specify intent, AI manages complexity"

### 🎓 Expert Insight: Organizational Plugins as Strategic Competitive Assets

Custom plugins encode your team's unique processes. This is a competitive advantage.

**Why This Matters:** Your plugins represent **organizational knowledge captured as executable code**. Unlike generic templates, your custom plugins embody:

- Your team's quality standards and review criteria
- Your CI/CD checks and performance thresholds
- Your security protocols and compliance requirements
- Your code style and architectural preferences
- Your documentation standards and deployment procedures

**Strategic Example: Custom PR Review Plugin**

Generic code review tools give you the same checks as every other team. Your custom `pr-review-toolkit` plugin, tuned for your codebase, catches issues competitors miss:

- Integration with your specific CI pipeline (not generic CI)
- Reviews against YOUR architectural patterns (not textbook patterns)
- Checks YOUR security checklist (not generic OWASP top 10)
- Validates YOUR performance budgets (not generic thresholds)

**Competitive Advantage:** This is **Tier 3 orchestration** (Principle 13) applied organizationally:

- Competitor: Manually coordinates multiple review tools (hours per PR)
- Your team: Plugin orchestrates reviews automatically (minutes per PR)
- Scaling: 10 parallel PRs reviewed simultaneously with consistent standards

**Business Impact:**

- **Productivity:** Less time in review cycles, more time building
- **Quality:** Consistent standards across all team members
- **Onboarding:** New team members inherit your standards automatically
- **Knowledge capture:** Best practices become code, not scattered wikis
- **Versioning:** Your standards evolve with your codebase

**Forward-Looking:** In Part 9 (Lesson 14), you'll learn how to share your plugins through marketplaces, creating organizational assets others can build on.

## Real Workflow: PR Review Automation
```

### Rationale

- **Strategic Framing**: Positions plugins as organizational assets (not just tools)
- **Competitive Context**: Shows business value (vs. competitors without plugins)
- **Scaling Concept**: Demonstrates Tier 3 orchestration at organizational scale
- **Forward-Looking**: Previews Part 9 marketplace sharing
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Accessible without deep technical background

### Constitutional Alignment

- Principle 13 (Tier 3): Organizational orchestration at scale
- Principle 2 (Spec-First): "Standards as executable specifications"
- Vision (AI-Native Development): Building strategic organizational capabilities

## Change 5: Practice Exercise - Map Your Workflow to Extensions

**Type**: INSERTION (specification practice activity)
**Location**: After line 362 (plugin management section), before line 364 (separator)
**Lines Added**: 366-386 (21 lines)
**Insertion Point**: Between "How to Manage Plugins" and "Creating Your Own Plugin"

### Before (lines 358-368):

```markdown
If you see "No marketplaces configured," add one first with `/plugin marketplace add ...`. If you see "No plugins installed," install one with `/plugin install name@marketplace` before enabling.

---

## Creating Your Own Plugin (Optional)

If you want to automate a workflow specific to your team, you can create a custom plugin.
```

### After (lines 358-394):

```markdown
If you see "No marketplaces configured," add one first with `/plugin marketplace add ...`. If you see "No plugins installed," install one with `/plugin install name@marketplace` before enabling.

---

### 🤝 Practice Exercise: Map Your Workflow to Extensions

Before creating a plugin, practice the specification-first thinking (Principle 2) by mapping your own workflow to the extension hierarchy.

**Your Task:**

1. Choose a repetitive multi-step workflow you do regularly (examples: PR review, feature deployment, testing pipeline, documentation generation)
2. Break it down using the hierarchy:
   - Which **commands** would you need? (explicit invocations)
   - Which **subagents** would handle specialized tasks? (isolated experts)
   - Which **skills** would provide ambient expertise? (automatic checks)
   - Which **hooks** would trigger automatically? (event-driven actions)
3. Write 3-5 sentences describing your plugin's orchestration logic

**Example Completed (Feature Development Workflow):**

- **Commands:** `/feature-dev` (main entry point)
- **Subagents:** Architecture planner, code generator, test writer, security reviewer
- **Skills:** Type checking, docstring validation, performance profiling
- **Hooks:** Pre-commit validates tests pass, post-push triggers CI/CD
- **Orchestration Logic:** The feature-dev plugin orchestrates all steps. When invoked, it guides you through requirements → design → implementation → testing → security review. Each step delegates to specialized subagents. Skills run automatically to catch issues early. Hooks ensure quality gates pass before merging.

**Why This Matters:** You're learning to think like a plugin architect—decomposing workflows into their components and recognizing where composition adds value. This specification thinking is Tier 3 orchestration (Principle 13).

---

## Creating Your Own Plugin (Optional)

If you want to automate a workflow specific to your team, you can create a custom plugin.
```

### Rationale

- **Specification Practice**: Students decompose workflows before building (Principle 2)
- **Hierarchical Thinking**: Reinforces extension hierarchy from Change 1
- **Scaffolding**: Completed example models expected output
- **Preparation**: Sets up plugin creation lesson with planning mindset

### Constitutional Alignment

- Principle 2 (Spec-First): "Design specifications before implementation"
- Principle 13 (Tier 3): "Thinking like a plugin architect"
- Principle 8 (Learning by Building): Practical decomposition exercise

## Change 6: Practice Exercise - Test Built-In Plugin

**Type**: INSERTION (hands-on experiential activity)
**Location**: After line 544 (real workflow example), before line 546 (separator)
**Lines Added**: 563-586 (24 lines)
**Insertion Point**: Between "Real Workflow: PR Review Automation" and "## Try With AI"

### Before (lines 540-546):

```markdown
**Time: 15 minutes**

## Try With AI

Now put plugins into practice.
```

### After (lines 540-591):

### 🤝 Practice Exercise: Test a Built-In Plugin

Hands-on experience cements understanding. Let's use a plugin and observe orchestration in action.

**Your Task:**

1. Choose one built-in plugin: `code-review`, `feature-dev`, `pr-review-toolkit`, or `commit-commands`
2. Use it in your current project on a recent piece of work
3. Observe what gets triggered:
   - Which **hooks** fired? (automatic triggers)
   - Which **subagents** were invoked? (look for parallel processing)
   - Which **skills** were applied? (automatic expertise checks)
4. Reflect: **What would this workflow look like WITHOUT plugin orchestration?** (Count manual steps)

**Example (Code Review Plugin):**

1. Enable: `/plugin enable code-review`
2. Run: `/code-review` on your recent PR
3. Observe:
   - Hook detected PR context automatically
   - 4 parallel review agents ran simultaneously
   - Code-quality skill checked security issues
   - Type-checking skill validated types
4. Reflection: "Without the plugin, I'd manually run linter + type checker + security scan + code style check = 4 separate manual steps. Plugin did all 4 in one invocation with parallel agents."

**Why This Matters:** You're experiencing Tier 3 orchestration (Principle 13) in action. The plugin abstracts away complexity—you request once, AI orchestrates everything. This is the power of composition.

---

## Try With AI

Now put plugins into practice.
```

### Rationale

- **Hands-On Experience**: Move from theory to actual plugin usage
- **Observation Focus**: Students observe hook/agent/skill triggering (not just outputs)
- **Before/After Reflection**: Reinforces orchestration value vs. manual process
- **Concrete Example**: Code-review plugin modeled with step-by-step instructions

### Constitutional Alignment

- Principle 8 (Learning by Building): Hands-on experiential practice
- Principle 13 (Tier 3): Observing orchestration in action
- Principle 5 (Validation-First): "Reflect on what you observe"

## Change 7: Removal of "What's Next" Section (DELETION)

**Type**: DELETION (removal of non-compliant section)
**Location**: End of file (original lines 653-671)
**Lines Removed**: 18 lines
**Reason**: AI-first closure policy requires lesson to end with "Try With AI" section; no post-sections allowed

### Deleted Content:

```markdown

## What's Next

You've now mastered **the full Claude Code stack**:

- ✅ **Installation** - Set up Claude Code on any platform
- ✅ **Commands** - Use daily workflows efficiently
- ✅ **Subagents** - Create specialized isolated assistants
- ✅ **Skills** - Encode team expertise for automatic application
- ✅ **MCP Servers** - Integrate external systems safely
- ✅ **Plugins** - Automate multi-step workflows

**In Part 5-6** (Advanced Orchestration), you'll learn:

- Git worktrees for parallel feature development
- Managing 3-10 AI agents simultaneously
- Coordinating complex decomposition strategies
- Building AI agent team orchestration

For now, **practice using what you've learned**. The real skill is recognizing when to use each tool (commands, subagents, skills, MCP, plugins) for maximum productivity.
```

### Rationale

- **AI-First Closure Policy**: Lesson must end with "Try With AI" for consistent cognitive load management
- **Content Preservation**: Message about "practice what you've learned" + "recognizing when to use each tool" can be integrated into subsequent chapters or Docusaurus navigation
- **Policy Compliance**: Constitutional requirement from output-styles/lesson.md

### Redistribution Notes

- "Practice using what you've learned" → Can be reinforced in Part 3 closure or Chapter 5 conclusion
- "Recognizing when to use each tool" → Addressed in Try With AI Exercise 2 (plugin scalability)
- "Advanced Orchestration in Part 5-6" → Natural progression; Docusaurus sidebar handles navigation
