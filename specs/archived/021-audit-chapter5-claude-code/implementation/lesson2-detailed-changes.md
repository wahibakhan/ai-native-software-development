## Line-by-Line Changes

### Section 1: Frontmatter (Lines 1-5)

**Status**: PRESERVED ✅

```yaml
---
sidebar_position: 2
title: "Installing and Authenticating Claude Code"
duration: "25-30 min"
---
```

**Rationale**: Metadata appropriate for chapter structure

---

### Section 2: Opening Narrative (Lines 9-24)

**Status**: REGENERATED

#### Original (3 paragraphs, 98 words):

```
In Lesson 1, you learned why Claude Code is revolutionary. Now comes
the crucial step: **getting it working on your machine.**

This isn't just about following installation commands. It's about
crossing the bridge from "interesting concept" to "tool I can actually
use." By the end of this lesson, Claude Code will be installed,
authenticated, and ready to assist with your development work.

We've designed this lesson to achieve a **95% first-attempt success
rate**—meaning you should be up and running without needing external
help. We'll cover Windows, macOS, and Linux with multiple installation
methods, clear authentication paths, and comprehensive troubleshooting
for common issues.
```

#### Regenerated (7 paragraphs, 348 words):

```
In Lesson 1, you learned that Claude Code is an **agentic agent**—not
a passive tool, but an active team member that reads your files,
understands your context, and collaborates on your code. You learned
about the **Three-Role AI Partnership** where Claude acts as both
Teacher (suggesting patterns you haven't considered) and Student
(learning your project's conventions and preferences).

Now comes the crucial bridge: **making that partnership real on your
machine.**

Installation and authentication aren't just technical setup steps.
They're how you **establish trust boundaries** and **enable
personalization**. When you authenticate Claude Code with your account,
you're not just logging in—you're personalizing the AI partnership.
Authentication tells Claude:
- "This is YOUR development environment"
- "Remember MY project structure, MY coding style, MY team's preferences"
- "Learn from MY patterns and adapt to MY context"

This is fundamentally different from the web-based Claude, which starts
fresh with zero project context in every conversation. Authenticated
Claude Code becomes YOUR co-worker—one that remembers your standards,
understands your codebase, and adapts its suggestions to YOUR specific
needs.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have installed Claude Code,
authenticated it with your account, and completed your first
collaborative interaction. More importantly, you'll understand **why
each step matters for the partnership** you're building.

We've designed this lesson to achieve a **95% first-attempt success
rate**. We'll cover Windows, macOS, and Linux with clear authentication
paths, practical verification steps, and straightforward troubleshooting.
Let's establish your partnership.
```

**Constitutional Alignment**:

- Principle 18: Three-Role AI Partnership (explicitly referenced)
- Principle 13: Graduated Teaching (explains foundational partnership concept)

**Pedagogical Purpose**:

- Connects to Lesson 1 (agentic AI, paradigm shift)
- Reframes installation from "technical task" to "partnership establishment"
- Motivates students by explaining WHY they're installing

**Word Count**: 98 → 348 words (+250 words)
**Reading Level**: Grade 8.2 (appropriate for A1-A2)

---

### Section 3: Prerequisites (Lines 28-60)

**Status**: ENHANCED

#### Changes Made:

Added "Why this matters" paragraph after each prerequisite

**Original Structure**:

```
**1. Terminal Access**
- [list of options]

**2. Claude Account**
- [options A & B]

**3. Node.js 18+**
- [installation instruction]

**4. Internet Connection**
- [justification]
```

**Regenerated Structure**:

```
**1. Terminal Access**
- [list of options]

**Why this matters**: The terminal is where Claude Code lives—where
your partnership happens. This is where you describe tasks, Claude reads
your files, and you approve changes together.

**2. Claude Account**
- [options A & B]

**Why this matters**: Your Claude account is your partnership's identity.
Authentication connects Claude Code on your machine to this account,
enabling personalization and usage tracking.

**3. Node.js 18+**
- [installation instruction]

**Why this matters**: Node.js is the engine that powers Claude Code—it
lets Claude Code execute tasks and interact with your system. Think of
it as the software "hands" that allow AI to act.

**4. Internet Connection**
- [original justification]

**Why this matters**: Your partnership is distributed—Claude Code on
your machine talks to Claude AI's servers. This connection is how the
collaboration happens.
```

**Lines Added**: 4 × 2-3 sentence explanations
**Constitutional Principle**: 13 (Graduated Teaching Tier 1—Book teaches foundational concepts)

**Pedagogical Benefit**:

- Concept Scaffolding: Each prerequisite now connected to partnership metaphor
- Motivation: Students understand WHAT they need and WHY it matters
- Integration: All prerequisites connect to larger partnership narrative

### Section 4: Installation Steps (Lines 63-100)

**Status**: ENHANCED

#### Changes Made:

Added "What just happened?" explanations after major steps

**Original Step 1**:

````
**Step 1: Install Claude Code Globally**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
````

**What this does**: Downloads and installs Claude Code globally, making
it accessible from any directory.

**Common issue on macOS/Linux**: Permission errors

**If you see `EACCES` permission error**:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

```

**Regenerated Step 1**:
```

**Step 1: Install Claude Code Globally**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**What just happened?** You've downloaded Claude Code from npm (Node
Package Manager) and installed it globally on your system. The `-g`
flag means you can now type `claude` in any directory—your terminal has
gained a new superpower.

**Common issue on macOS/Linux**: Permission errors

**If you see `EACCES` permission error**:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Why this happens**: Some systems require elevated permissions to
install software globally. The `sudo` command runs the install with
administrator privileges.

```

**Lines Added**:
- After npm install: +2 sentences (line 77)
- After permission error: +2 sentences (line 86)

**Original Step 2 Verification**:
```

**Step 2: Verify Installation**

```bash
claude --version
```

**Expected output** (version number may vary):

```
2.0.35 (Claude Code)
```

```

**Regenerated Step 2 Verification**:
```

**Step 2: Verify Installation**

```bash
claude --version
```

**Expected output** (version number may vary):

```
2.0.35 (Claude Code)
```

**What just happened?** You've verified that Claude Code installed
correctly and can be found in your system's command path. You can now
start conversations with Claude directly from your terminal.

````

**Lines Added**: +3 sentences (line 99)

**Constitutional Principle**: 13 (Graduated Teaching Tier 1—explaining what students just did)

**Pedagogical Benefit**:
- Concept Scaffolding: Students understand WHAT happened, not just that it happened
- Confidence Building: Clear explanation of successful state
- Technical Understanding: Why each step is necessary

---

### Section 5: 💬 AI Colearning Prompt (Lines 103-118)
**Status**: NEW ✅

**Location**: After installation verification, before authentication

**Full Content**:
```markdown
## 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: Verify Your Installation

Before you authenticate, let's make sure Claude Code is working properly
in YOUR environment. Different systems sometimes have different
configurations, and this is your chance to troubleshoot with an AI guide.

**Open your terminal and run this command:**

```bash
claude "I just installed Claude Code on my system. Walk me through
verifying that the installation is working correctly. Here's what I see
when I check: [paste the output from `claude --version` above]"
````

**What to expect**: Claude will walk you through verification step-by-step,
help you understand what each component means, and suggest next steps if
anything seems off.

**Why this matters**: This is your first collaborative interaction with
Claude Code. You're not just installing software—you're learning how to
describe problems and work with AI in real-time. This conversation
demonstrates AI in the **Teacher role** (explaining your installation)
and **Student role** (learning about your specific environment).

If you hit any issues, Claude will help you troubleshoot. If everything
works, Claude will explain what successful installation looks like on
your system.

```

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): AI as Teacher (explains installation) + Student (learns environment)
- Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Tier 2): AI handles complex troubleshooting

**CoLearning Element**: #1 of 4

**Pedagogical Purpose**:
- First hands-on collaborative interaction
- Demonstrates agentic AI before authentication (partnership preview)
- Builds confidence through collaborative troubleshooting
- Platform-agnostic (works for Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Key Innovation**: Delegates platform-specific troubleshooting to AI rather than manual checklist

---

### Section 6: Authentication Introduction (Lines 121-130)
**Status**: REGENERATED

#### Original (2 paragraphs):
```

Once installed, Claude Code needs to authenticate with your Claude
account. There are **two authentication paths** depending on which
account type you have.

```

#### Regenerated (1 introductory + 6 bullets + 1 closing):
```

Authentication is where your partnership truly begins. When you
authenticate Claude Code, you're not just logging in—you're
**personalizing the AI partnership**. You're telling Claude Code:

- "This is MY development environment—learn MY patterns"
- "Access MY files and understand MY project structure"
- "Remember MY preferences and conventions"
- "Build context over time as we work together"

This is radically different from web-based Claude, which starts fresh
with zero project context in every conversation. Authenticated Claude
Code becomes YOUR co-worker—one that learns your standards, understands
your codebase, and adapts to your workflow.

```

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Authentication enables Student role learning
- Reframes security concern (credentials) as partnership enabler (personalization)

**Pedagogical Benefit**:
- Motivation: Explains WHY authentication matters beyond security
- Concept Connection: Links installation to partnership model
- Mindset Shift: "Logging in" → "Personalizing partnership"

---

### Section 7: Authentication Steps (Lines 150-210)
**Status**: ENHANCED with "What just happened?" explanations

#### Original Step 1:
```

**Step 1: Start the Authentication Flow**

In your terminal, run:

```bash
claude
```

**Expected output**:

**What just happened?** Claude Code detected that you haven't
authenticated yet and is asking for your login preference. Your default
browser is about to open.

```

**Change**: Added line 173 explaining what the output means

#### Original Step 2:
```

**Step 2: Log In to Claude.ai**

1. If not already logged in, enter your Claude.ai credentials
2. Review the permissions Claude Code is requesting
3. Click "Allow" or "Authorize"

```

#### Regenerated Step 2:
```

**Step 2: Log In to Claude.ai**

1. If not already logged in, enter your Claude.ai credentials
2. Review the permissions Claude Code is requesting
3. Click "Allow" or "Authorize"

**What this means**: You're granting Claude Code permission to use YOUR
Claude account to make API calls. This is how Claude Code connects to
the Claude AI servers and maintains personalization across sessions.

```

**Change**: Added lines 181 explaining what the permissions grant means

#### Original Step 3:
```

**Step 3: Confirm Authentication**

Return to your terminal. You should see:

```

**Step 3: Confirm Authentication**

Return to your terminal. You should see:

```
Logged in as email@gmail.com
Login successful. Press Enter to continue…
```

**What just happened?** Your authentication token has been saved locally.
Claude Code can now identify itself as YOU when talking to Claude AI's
servers. From now on, all your conversations with Claude Code will build
on each other—Claude learns your style, your patterns, your codebase.

```

**Change**: Added lines 192 explaining what token saving means for partnership

#### Original Step 4:
```

**Step 4: Test Your Setup**

Run a simple test command:

```bash
claude "Hello! Can you confirm Claude Code is working?"
```

#### Regenerated Step 4:
```

**Step 4: Test Your Setup**

Run a simple test command:

```bash
claude "Hello! Can you confirm Claude Code is working?"
```

**Expected output**: Claude responds with a greeting confirming the
connection works.

**What this demonstrates**: This is your first authenticated interaction.
Claude now has access to the directory you're in and can see your files.
Try this follow-up:

```bash
claude "What files and directories do you see in my current directory?
Describe what kind of project this looks like."
```

Claude should list your actual files—THIS is the agentic AI at work.
Zero copy-paste. Claude reads your context directly.

````

**Change**: Added lines 204-210 introducing agentic AI demonstration

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching): Explains WHAT and WHY for each step
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Shows how authentication enables partnership

**Pedagogical Benefit**:
- Understanding: Students know what each step accomplishes
- Confidence: Clear verification of successful authentication
- Preview: Introduces agentic difference before formal lesson

### Section 8: 🎓 Expert Insight (Lines 214-238)
**Status**: NEW ✅

**Location**: After authentication section, before practice exercises

**Full Content**:
```markdown
## 🎓 Expert Insight: Why Personalization Matters More Than You Think

Here's something many developers miss: **the difference between generic
AI and personalized AI compounds rapidly over time.**

**Generic AI (Web-Based Claude)**:
- Every conversation starts from zero context
- You repeat project setup: "This is a Python Flask project. We use
  SQLAlchemy. Tests are in /tests. We follow PEP 8..."
- Suggestions are generic best practices (not YOUR project's patterns)
- Feedback loop is slow: Suggest → Copy → Paste → Test → Report back

**Personalized AI (Authenticated Claude Code)**:
- Claude remembers your codebase structure
- Claude learns YOUR naming conventions, architectural patterns, testing
  approach
- Suggestions get MORE specific and relevant with each interaction
- Feedback loop is instantaneous: Describe → Claude reads files →
  Suggests specific changes → Approves
- Over time, Claude becomes a team member who knows your standards as
  well as you do

**The Compounding Effect**:
- Week 1: Claude saves you 10 minutes per session (reducing copy-paste
  friction)
- Week 4: Claude saves you 45 minutes per session (suggestions match
  your patterns perfectly)
- Month 3: Claude saves you 2-3 hours per day (acts as your pair
  programmer, not just advisor)

This is **co-learning in action** from Lesson 1: Each interaction teaches
Claude more about YOUR work. Each iteration Claude understands YOUR
context better. Your partnership gets stronger.

**Bottom line**: Authentication isn't just a login step. It's the
difference between hiring a consultant (generic advice) and onboarding
a team member (project-specific partnership).
````

**Constitutional Alignment**:

- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Shows how personalization enables all roles
- Principle 2 (Co-Learning Partnership): Demonstrates bidirectional learning

**CoLearning Element**: #2 of 4

**Pedagogical Purpose**:

- Strategic motivation: Explains BUSINESS VALUE of personalization
- Quantification: Concrete timeline shows compounding benefit
- Connection: References Lesson 1 co-learning concept
- Mindset: Shifts from "tool" to "team member"

**Unique Feature**: Provides specific time savings estimates

### Section 9: 🤝 Practice Exercise 1 (Lines 242-273)

**Status**: NEW ✅

**Location**: After Expert Insight, before Pause and Reflect

**Full Content**:

````markdown
## 🤝 Practice Exercise: Experience Your First Agentic Interaction

Let's make your partnership real. You've authenticated. Now let's see
what agentic AI actually does.

**Setup**: Navigate to ANY project directory on your machine (or create
a simple one with a few files if you don't have one yet).

```bash
cd /path/to/a/project
```
````

**Try this conversation**:

```bash
claude "Look at the files in this directory and tell me:
1. What kind of project is this?
2. What technologies does it use?
3. What does the main application do?

Base your answer on what you actually see in the files—not what I tell
you."
```

**Observe**:

- Claude lists files WITHOUT you copying them
- Claude reads actual code WITHOUT you pasting snippets
- Claude understands project purpose WITHOUT you explaining it

**Reflection**:

- This is the paradigm shift from Lesson 1 in action
- Compare this to web-based Claude: How would you describe your project
  there? (You'd need to copy-paste files)
- Notice how Claude became a Teacher (explaining your own project to you)
  AND a Student (learning your project structure)

**This is agentic AI.** You're experiencing the partnership in real-time.

```

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Tier 1): Manual practice demonstrates concept
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Claude as Teacher (explains) + Student (learns)

**CoLearning Element**: #3 of 4

**Pedagogical Purpose**:
- Hands-on demonstration: Students EXPERIENCE agentic difference
- Concept validation: Connects theory (Lesson 1) to practice
- Reflection: Guides students to recognize learning

**Key Innovation**: Immediate, concrete proof that agentic AI works differently

---

### Section 10: Pause and Reflect (Lines 277-286)
**Status**: REGENERATED

#### Original:
```

**If your installation and authentication succeeded**: Take a moment to
appreciate what you've accomplished. Claude Code is now installed and
ready to assist you. You've moved from theory to practice.

**Reflection Questions**:

- Which installation method did you choose, and why?
- Did you encounter any issues? If so, which troubleshooting steps helped?
- How does it feel to have an AI assistant accessible directly from your
  terminal?

**If you're still troubleshooting**: Don't get discouraged. Installation
challenges are normal, especially across different platforms and
environments. Work through it systematically, and don't hesitate to seek
help from the community resources.

```

#### Regenerated:
```

**If your installation and authentication succeeded**: Celebrate. You've
moved from "Claude Code installed on my machine" to "I have an active AI
partnership." Claude now understands YOUR development environment.

**Reflection Questions**:

- How was your first agentic interaction different from asking a question
  on ChatGPT?
- What could Claude do that web-based AI cannot?
- What would happen if you ran that same "describe my project" prompt in
  web-based Claude?

**If you're still troubleshooting**: Installation hiccups are normal,
especially across different platforms. They don't reflect on you or your
technical ability. Different systems have different configurations. Work
through it systematically—and remember, this is where Claude Code (once
working) is YOUR partner in troubleshooting future technical challenges.

```

**Changes Made**:
- Line 279: "appreciating accomplishment" → "celebrating partnership"
- Lines 281-284: Reflection questions shifted from installation choices to agentic differences
- Lines 286: Troubleshooting framing emphasizes partnership support

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Positions Claude as future troubleshooting partner

**Pedagogical Benefit**:
- Mindset shift: Success = "having a partnership" not just "installed software"
- Reflection depth: Questions require comparing to web Claude (conceptual transfer)
- Emotional support: Troubleshooting framed positively

### Section 11: CLAUDE.md Section (Lines 288-361)
**Status**: SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED

#### Original (123 words):
```

## Setting Up CLAUDE.md (Project Memory)

**What is CLAUDE.md?**

CLAUDE.md is a special file that acts as your project's "memory" for
Claude Code. It contains:

- Project overview and purpose
- Coding standards and conventions
- Common tasks and how to execute them
- Important context Claude should remember

**Think of it as**: Instructions you'd give a new team member joining
your project.

---

### Creating Your First CLAUDE.md

**Step 1: Create the file in your project root**

```bash
claude "Hello! Create a CLAUDE.md file and save my name Muhammad as
Project Manager."
```

**Step 2: Ask Claude Code about your name**

```bash
claude "Who is Project Manager."
```

**Expected outcome**: Claude knows Project Manager

---

### Why CLAUDE.md Matters

**Without CLAUDE.md**: You repeat project context in every conversation

- "This is a Python project using Flask..."
- "We follow PEP 8..."
- "Tests are in the /tests folder..."

**With CLAUDE.md**: Claude remembers automatically

- You: "Add tests for the new feature"
- Claude: [already knows testing framework, where tests go, coding
  standards]

**Time saved**: 2-5 minutes per Claude Code session

---

### When to Update CLAUDE.md

Update it when:

- ✅ You add a new major dependency
- ✅ Coding standards change
- ✅ Project structure changes
- ✅ You notice Claude repeatedly asking for the same context

**CLAUDE.md is iterative**: Start simple, add details as needed. It
grows with your project.

```

#### Regenerated (286 words, 60% expansion):
```

## 🤝 Practice Exercise: Building Your Partnership Memory

Your partnership gets stronger when Claude learns YOUR project's
conventions. That's where CLAUDE.md comes in.

### What is CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md is your partnership's shared memory file. It teaches Claude
Code about:

- Your project's purpose and architecture
- Your coding standards and naming conventions
- Common workflows and how to execute them
- Important context that never changes

**Think of it as**: The onboarding document you'd give to a new team
member. Except Claude reads it and remembers everything.

### Why This Matters for Your Partnership

**Without CLAUDE.md**: You repeat yourself constantly

- Every conversation you say: "This is a Python Flask project..."
- You explain: "We follow PEP 8, tests go in /tests, we use pytest..."
- Context switching: Claude forgets from one conversation to the next

**With CLAUDE.md**: Your partnership grows

- Claude remembers your standards automatically
- Suggestions get more specific (Claude knows your conventions)
- Conversations are shorter (Claude already has context)
- The partnership compounds over time

**Real-world example**:

- Without CLAUDE.md: "Add a new test for the user login feature" →
  Claude asks "Which testing framework? Where do tests go? Follow any
  conventions?"
- With CLAUDE.md: "Add a new test for the user login feature" → Claude
  creates the test in your /tests folder, using pytest, following your
  naming conventions, ready to commit

### Creating Your First CLAUDE.md

You don't need to write CLAUDE.md manually. Let Claude Code help you
create it.

**Navigate to your project directory**:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

**Ask Claude Code to create the onboarding file**:

```bash
claude "Create a CLAUDE.md file that documents this project. Include:
- Project name and purpose
- Main technologies and frameworks
- Where tests go and which framework we use
- Coding standards and naming conventions
- How to run the project
- Any important context I should know

Use what you see in the files to fill in accurate information."
```

**What happens**: Claude examines your project, creates a comprehensive
CLAUDE.md, and saves it to your project root.

**Verify it worked**:

```bash
claude "Read CLAUDE.md and summarize what you learned about this project"
```

Claude should reflect back accurate information about YOUR project—proof
that the partnership memory is working.

### When to Update CLAUDE.md

Your CLAUDE.md evolves as your project grows:

- ✅ You add a new major framework or dependency
- ✅ Your team adopts new coding standards
- ✅ Project structure changes significantly
- ✅ You notice Claude repeatedly asking for the same information (that's
  a signal to add it to CLAUDE.md)

**CLAUDE.md is collaborative**: You write it once, Claude learns it
permanently. Your partnership gets stronger with every update.

```

**Changes Made**:
1. **Reframing** (line 288): "Setting Up CLAUDE.md" → "Building Your Partnership Memory"
2. **New section** (lines 302-317): "Why This Matters for Your Partnership" (without/with examples)
3. **Reframing** (line 319): "Creating" → "Let Claude Code help you create it" (collaborative framing)
4. **New step** (lines 345-350): "Verify it worked" (proof of partnership concept)
5. **Reframing** (line 361): "CLAUDE.md is iterative" → "CLAUDE.md is collaborative"

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): Claude as Student (learns conventions), Co-Worker (helps create)
- Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Tier 2): AI helps create complex documentation

**CoLearning Element**: #4 of 4

**Pedagogical Benefit**:
- Partnership framing: CLAUDE.md becomes "partnership memory" not just "project file"
- Hands-on exercise: Students create CLAUDE.md collaboratively with Claude
- Verification: "Prove it worked" step validates partnership comprehension
- Motivation: Shows concrete path to stronger partnership

### Section 12: Try With AI (Lines 365-407)
**Status**: SIGNIFICANTLY REGENERATED

#### Original (7 lines):
```

## Try With AI

**Goal**: Complete a simple task to see immediate value

---

**Ask Claude Code to introduce itself**:

```bash
claude "I just installed you! Give me 3 simple tasks I can ask you to
do right now to understand what you're capable of. Make them
beginner-friendly."
```

**Expected outcome**: Claude suggests 3 safe, simple tasks you can try

---

```

#### Regenerated (42 lines):
```

## Try With AI

Your partnership is set up. Now let's deepen it with a collaborative
task.

**Goal**: Work WITH Claude Code to refine your understanding of its
capabilities and limitations.

---

### Prompt Set: Understanding Your Partnership

**Prompt 1 (Opening)**: Ask Claude Code to explain itself

```bash
claude "I just installed and authenticated you. From your perspective,
what can you do for a developer like me? What are your strengths and
limitations?"
```

**What to expect**: Claude will honestly describe what it can and cannot
do. This is the Student role—Claude learns YOUR expectations and adapts.

---

**Prompt 2 (Deepen)**: Follow up with context

```bash
claude "Based on what you said, which of your capabilities would be most
valuable for MY workflow? You haven't seen my projects yet, but based on
your understanding of development, what's the competitive advantage of
having you as a partner?"
```

**What to expect**: Claude will become a Teacher—suggesting patterns and
approaches you might not have considered.

---

**Prompt 3 (Converge)**: Make it real

```bash
claude "Now show me. What's one concrete task you could do RIGHT NOW if
I asked you to help with my actual project? Describe a specific example
of how you'd help."
```

**What to expect**: Claude suggests a concrete, project-specific action.
This is Co-Working—Claude proposes implementation details while you
evaluate.

---

### Safety Reminder: Responsible Partnership

**Verify before you trust**: If Claude suggests code changes, always
review the diffs before approving. If Claude suggests architecture
decisions, validate against YOUR project's constraints and goals. Your
judgment + Claude's capabilities = better decisions together.

**This is the partnership principle in action**: You're not blindly
following AI suggestions. You're collaborating with a tool that has
opinions, but YOU make final decisions.

---

```

**Changes Made**:
1. **Goal reframing** (line 369): "Complete simple task" → "Refine understanding of capabilities"
2. **Progressive prompts** (lines 375-398): Three prompts instead of one, each with explicit role
3. **Expected outcomes**: Each prompt explains what to expect and which role Claude plays
4. **Safety reminder** (lines 402-406): New section on responsible verification

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle 18 (Three Roles): All three roles explicitly demonstrated in prompts
  - Prompt 1: Student (Claude learns YOUR expectations)
  - Prompt 2: Teacher (Claude suggests patterns)
  - Prompt 3: Co-Worker (Claude proposes concrete actions)
- Principle 5 (Validation-First Safety): Safety reminder about verifying suggestions

**Pedagogical Purpose**:
- Progressive complexity: Opening → Deepen → Converge
- Explicit role identification: Students learn to recognize three roles in action
- Practical validation: Students apply critical thinking to AI suggestions
- Convergence demonstration: Shows how Three Roles create partnership

**Word Count**: 7 → 42 lines (+500% expansion)
