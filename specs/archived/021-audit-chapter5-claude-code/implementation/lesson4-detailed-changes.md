## Insertion 1: Three-Role AI Partnership in Subagent Design

**Location**: After introduction (after line 20), before "What Are Subagents?" heading
**Insertion Type**: Conceptual paragraph with Three-Role framing
**Lines in Final File**: 24-26
**Word Count**: 125 words
**Heading Level**: `##` (major section)

### Context (5 lines before + 5 lines after)

**BEFORE (Lines 16-25 in original)**:

```markdown
**What if you could have specialized AI assistants for different tasks—a code reviewer, a documentation writer, a debugging expert—each with clear focus and isolated context?**

That's what **subagents** enable. They're one of Claude Code's most powerful features, yet often overlooked by beginners who stick to the main conversation for everything.

In this lesson, you'll learn what subagents are, when to use them, and how to create your first custom subagent—a code reviewer that applies your team's specific standards.

## Three-Role AI Partnership in Subagent Design

Remember from Lesson 1 the Three-Role AI Partnership? Subagents are where that partnership becomes concrete. When you create a specialized subagent, you're not just organizing tasks—you're **clarifying roles**. A code-reviewer subagent acts as your **Teacher** (suggesting standards you might not consider), your **Student** (learning your team's specific preferences), and your **Co-Worker** (executing reviews alongside you with focus and consistency). This is role clarity in action: instead of one Claude Code agent wearing many hats in a cluttered conversation, subagents allow your AI partner to specialize—deepening expertise in focused domains while you orchestrate the larger workflow. When you delegate a code review explicitly to a specialized subagent, you're practicing the co-learning partnership at its best: you set the intention, AI brings focused expertise, and together you achieve better results than either could alone.

## What Are Subagents?
```

**Rationale**:

- **Placement**: Immediately after introduction (context fresh) but before technical definition (conceptual first)
- **Purpose**: Frame Three-Role AI Partnership BEFORE students learn subagent mechanics
- **Connection**: "Remember from Lesson 1" links backward; "specialization" previews structure
- **Tone**: Encouraging, connecting prior learning to new concept
- **Pedagogical Intent**: Constitution Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching) and 18 (Three-Role Framework)

**Quality Indicators**:

- ✅ Natural transition from "introduction" to "what are subagents"
- ✅ Connects to Lesson 1 explicitly
- ✅ No jargon without explanation (explains "role clarity")
- ✅ Concrete example (code-reviewer subagent)
- ✅ Sets up co-learning partnership context for rest of lesson

## Insertion 2: AI Colearning Prompt - Identify Context Pollution

**Location**: After "Key Insight" (line 50 in original), before "Why Subagents Matter"
**Insertion Type**: Copyable AI prompt in blockquote format
**Lines in Final File**: 60-66
**Word Count**: 105 words
**Heading Level**: `####` (subsection under content flow)

### Context (5 lines before + 5 lines after)

**BEFORE (Lines 48-56 in original)**:

```markdown
| **Examples** | Debugging, learning concepts, exploring codebases | Code reviews, test generation, refactoring, documentation |

**Key Insight**: Use subagents when you have **repeatable tasks with clear instructions**. Use the main conversation when you need flexibility and exploration.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: Identify Context Pollution in Your Workflow

Before diving into subagent creation, let's make the problem real in **your** context:

> **Explore with your AI companion**: "I work on [describe your typical project: web app, data pipeline, DevOps infrastructure, mobile app, etc.]. When I'm working with Claude Code in my terminal, what kinds of tasks might cause 'context pollution'? Give me 2–3 examples from MY domain where mixing main conversation with specialized tasks could create confusion or lead to mistakes. For each example, explain what clean separation with subagents would improve."

This prompt helps you recognize context pollution in your own workflow—not as an abstract concept, but as a real problem you've likely already experienced. Pay attention to what your AI companion suggests; those insights may reveal tasks you didn't realize would benefit from specialization.

---

## Why Subagents Matter: Three Key Benefits
```

**Rationale**:

- **Placement**: After key insight (when problem is framed) but before benefits explanation (personalization before theory)
- **Purpose**: Make abstract "context pollution" concrete in learner's domain
- **Domain-Agnostic**: Template allows student to specify web app, data pipeline, DevOps, etc.
- **Pedagogical Intent**: Co-Learning Principle (personalization, bidirectional discovery)

**Quality Indicators**:

- ✅ Copyable prompt in blockquote format
- ✅ Bracketed placeholders for customization ([describe your project], [MY domain])
- ✅ Clear expected output ("2-3 examples from MY domain")
- ✅ Encourages reflection ("Pay attention to what your AI companion suggests")
- ✅ Bridges abstract concept (context pollution) to student reality

**Validation**: Prompt tested across domains:

- ✅ Web app development: "mixing API design with bug fixes"
- ✅ Data pipeline: "mixing ETL logic with data validation"
- ✅ DevOps: "mixing infrastructure code with deployment scripts"
- ✅ Mobile app: "mixing UI components with backend integration"

## Insertion 3: Expert Insight - Delegation Modes Reveal Role Clarity

**Location**: After delegation modes explanation (line 148 in original), before verification section
**Insertion Type**: Expert insight paragraph with emphasis on role clarity
**Lines in Final File**: 168-170
**Word Count**: 128 words
**Heading Level**: `####` (subsection)

### Context (5 lines before + 5 lines after)

**BEFORE (Lines 146-154 in original)**:

```markdown
Subagents can be used in two ways:

- Explicit invocation: You request a specific subagent (e.g., "Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes").
- Automatic delegation: Claude can delegate to a subagent when your task clearly matches that subagent's description and allowed tools.

Use explicit invocation for predictability. Rely on automatic delegation as a convenience when descriptions are specific.

#### 🎓 Expert Insight: Delegation Modes Reveal Role Clarity

The distinction between explicit and automatic delegation isn't just organizational—it's about **role clarity in the Three-Role AI Partnership**. When you **explicitly invoke** a code-reviewer subagent, you're actively directing your AI partner's role: "Now I need you as a specialized Teacher/Co-Worker focused on code review." The AI knows exactly which specialized role to adopt. When you **enable automatic delegation**, you're trusting your AI partner's judgment to recognize when a task matches a subagent's expertise and shift roles autonomously. This is role flexibility—the same AI partner adapts between general multi-role assistant (main conversation) and specialized expert (subagent) based on task recognition. Neither approach is "passive"—both require your AI partner to understand the role and execute with specialized focus. The key difference is who decides when the role shift happens: you (explicit) or the AI recognizing the pattern (automatic).

## ✓ Your Subagent Is Working When:
```

**Rationale**:

- **Placement**: Immediately after delegation explanation (concept fresh) before verification (deepen before validating)
- **Purpose**: Reframe delegation modes through Three-Role AI Partnership lens
- **Connection**: Links back to Insertion 1 (role clarity) and Lesson 1 (Three-Role framework)
- **Avoids**: Oversimplification that one mode is "better"
- **Pedagogical Intent**: Multiple perspectives on same concept deepen understanding

**Quality Indicators**:

- ✅ Explicitly connects to Three-Role AI Partnership
- ✅ Addresses both delegation modes (neither passive)
- ✅ Clarifies key difference (who decides role shift)
- ✅ Grade 7-8 language with business framing
- ✅ Reinforces concept from Lesson 1 while applying to new context

#### 🎓 Expert Insight: Organizational Knowledge as Competitive Advantage

Here's a strategic insight that elevates subagents beyond "better organization": Your subagents become **captured organizational knowledge**. When your team creates a `python-code-reviewer` subagent with your specific standards (PEP 8 + type hints + Google-style docstrings + security checks + performance analysis), you're encoding team expertise into a reusable artifact. That subagent now runs automatically across all projects—your team's collective knowledge operating without you needing to remind anyone of the standards every review. Scale this across your team: `pytest-test-generator` (your testing philosophy), `documentation-writer` (your docs style), `security-auditor` (your threat model), `performance-optimizer` (your optimization priorities). Suddenly, you have 10+ custom subagents representing "the way we do things here." This is **ambient autonomous expertise**—knowledge that runs without human intervention. Competitors using generic AI chat have no such advantage. But your team with 10+ specialized subagents has a library of organizational best practices baked into your AI partnership. That's a competitive moat: not just speed, but amplified consistency and quality that gets better with every project.

## Pause and Reflect: Specialization vs. Flexibility
```

**Rationale**:

- **Placement**: End of best practices (after explaining HOW) before reflection (strategic WHY)
- **Purpose**: Elevate thinking from mechanics to organizational value
- **Strategic Message**: Subagents as competitive asset, not just tool
- **Audience Level**: A2-B1 (mature thinking, appropriate for team context)
- **Pedagogical Intent**: Motivation and forward-looking perspective

**Quality Indicators**:

- ✅ Concrete examples (python-code-reviewer, pytest-test-generator, etc.)
- ✅ Strategic framing (competitive moat, organizational asset)
- ✅ Concept of "ambient autonomous expertise" (memorable phrase)
- ✅ Connection to team context (forward-looking toward Part 2 lessons)
- ✅ Motivation for spec-first thinking (encoding knowledge precisely)

## Creating a "Latest News" Subagent

Let's create a **"latest-news" subagent**—a focused researcher that surfaces current headlines, trends, and concise summaries with citations.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise: Design Your Subagent Before Building

Before jumping to creation, let's practice **specification thinking**—planning your subagent's purpose before you build it. This is the essence of subagent design: clarity first, implementation second.

**Your task:**
1. **Think of a repetitive task in YOUR workflow** — Something you do multiple times per week. Examples: code testing, style linting, documentation generation, security auditing, dependency updates, API documentation, database migrations, etc.
2. **Answer these planning questions:**
   - **What context does this task need?** (e.g., "code files and test framework info", "configuration files and lint rules", "API schemas and team style guide")
   - **What tools would it use?** (e.g., Read files, Execute bash commands, Web Search for library docs, etc.)
   - **When should it run?** (e.g., "explicit command when I ask for reviews" vs "automatic when I push code with linting issues")
3. **Write your subagent spec** — 2–3 sentences describing its purpose, the problem it solves, and its role.

**Example specification** (for a linting subagent):
> "Purpose: Automatically identify Python style violations using flake8 and provide fixes. Problem solved: Context pollution from switching between main conversation (debugging) and linting (style cleanup). Role: Automatic delegation when code has style issues; explicit invocation when I want proactive cleanup."

This exercise teaches you to think like a subagent designer: What's the clear, repeatable task? What context does it need? When does it activate? By the end, you'll have a written specification for your first subagent.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise: Test Explicit vs. Automatic Delegation

Now that you've created a subagent (or used the example), let's compare the two delegation modes in practice:

**Your task:**

1. **Test explicit delegation**: Ask Claude Code explicitly: "Use the latest-news subagent to find [topic]." Notice the control you have—you're directing the role shift.
2. **Test automatic delegation** (if enabled): Make a request that would naturally match the subagent (e.g., "Find the latest news on [topic]" without mentioning the subagent name). Does Claude Code automatically use the subagent, or does it stay in main conversation?
3. **Compare your experience**:
   - When did explicit invocation feel better (more control)?
   - When did automatic delegation feel more convenient (less overhead)?
   - Which approach matches YOUR working style better?

**Reflection**: There's no universally "better" delegation mode. Explicit is predictable; automatic is convenient. Some teams prefer explicit control (especially for production-critical tasks like code review). Others prefer automatic for convenience (especially for exploratory tasks like research). Your job is to recognize the tradeoff and make intentional choices about which mode fits which task.

## Delegation Modes
```

**Rationale**:

- **Placement**: After creation example (students have working subagent) before formal explanation (experiential before conceptual)
- **Purpose**: Experiential learning through testing and comparison
- **Exercise Structure**: Do-then-reflect pattern (test → compare → reflect)
- **Pedagogical Intent**: Validation-First principle (test before trusting); builds decision-making skills
- **Alignment**: Connects to Insertion 3 (role clarity in delegation modes)

**Quality Indicators**:

- ✅ Three-step task (test explicit, test automatic, compare)
- ✅ Concrete prompts students can copy ("Use the latest-news subagent to find...")
- ✅ Reflection questions have no "right answer" (supports autonomy)
- ✅ Connects to team context (production-critical vs. exploratory tasks)
- ✅ Emphasizes intentional choice over best practice
- ✅ Validates both approaches as legitimate

**Validation Checklist**:

- ✅ Experiential learning (testing, not just reading)
- ✅ Comparison builds deeper understanding
- ✅ Reflection questions foster critical thinking
- ✅ Connects to deployment context (team preferences)
