## Constitutional Alignment

**Principle 3: Specification-First Development**

- ✓ Hooks framed as executable specifications
- ✓ Automation Thinking Pattern teaches specification thinking
- ✓ Exercise 1 emphasizes "design before code"

**Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern**

- ✓ Tier 1: Book teaches hook types and automation patterns
- ✓ Tier 2: AI Companion creates hooks (student specifies, AI executes)
- ✓ Tier 3: Optional advanced orchestration (clearly marked optional)

**Principle 18: Three-Role AI Partnership**

- ✓ AI as Teacher: Suggests domain-specific patterns (Prompt 1)
- ✓ AI as Student: Interviews user, learns workflow, adapts (Exercise 2)
- ✓ AI as Co-Worker: Collaborates on implementation (Exercise 3)

---

## Key Additions

### 1. Automation Thinking Pattern (Lines 47-111)

A structured 4-step framework teaching HOW to think about automation:

1. **Identify Tedious** — What manual task?
2. **Choose Hook Type** — WHEN should it run?
3. **Define Matcher** — WHAT triggers it?
4. **Specify Action** — DO WHAT?

**Why**: Gives students a mental model for applying hooks to ANY repetitive task.

### 2. Strategic Use Cases (Throughout Hook Types)

Each hook type now includes:

- Concrete examples
- "Why this matters" explanation
- Time/value impact

**Example** (SessionStart):

```
A 3-second environment check at session start prevents 30 minutes of wasted work later.
```

**Why**: Emphasizes value, not just mechanics.

### 3. CoLearning Elements (6 Total)

**Prompt 1: Identify YOUR Automation Opportunities** (lines 114-121)

- AI as Teacher suggesting domain-specific patterns
- Works for any tech stack (web, data, DevOps, mobile)

**Insight 1: Strategic Delegation to Your AI Co-Worker** (lines 197-224)

- Explains Three-Role partnership
- Tier 2 context
- Organizational value (compounding effect)

**Exercise 1: Design Your First Hook (Specification-First)** (lines 228-266)

- MOVED EARLIER (before implementation)
- Emphasizes planning before code
- ROI check (is this worth automating?)

**Insight 2: Strategic Hook Management** (lines 628-691)

- Team adoption patterns
- Documentation best practices
- Version control strategy

**Exercise 2: Create and Test Your First Hook** (lines 829-869)

- Hands-on implementation
- Reflection prompts
- Iteration cycle

**Prompt 2: Strategic Hook Library Design** (lines 873-884)

- Team-focused planning
- Prioritization and rollout order
- Specs as Strategic Assets

### 4. Three-Role Try With AI Exercises (Lines 888-952)

**Exercise 1: Claude as Teacher**

```
Analyze my development workflow... identify 3-4 automation opportunities...
```

Student learns: Domain-specific hook patterns from AI expertise

**Exercise 2: Claude as Student**

```
Interview me about my development workflow... design 2-3 custom hooks specifically for my workflow
```

Student learns: AI learns from their context and adapts

**Exercise 3: Claude as Co-Worker**

```
Help me: (1) Choose hook type... (2) Write JSON... (3) Specify permissions... (4) Test...
```

Student learns: Collaborative implementation (you specify, AI handles syntax)

## Key Features of Regeneration

### 1. Personalization

**Before**: Generic "What are hooks?"
**After**: "Your Tedious Tasks: The Automation Starting Point" — addresses student pain points first

### 2. Specification-First Emphasis

**Pattern**: Tedious → Hook Type → Matcher → Action
**Practice**: Exercise 1 teaches specification BEFORE implementation
**Philosophy**: Hooks = specifications you write once, Claude enforces forever

### 3. Strategic Framing

**Before**: Hooks are features
**After**: Hooks are:

- Specifications (Principle 3)
- Tier 2 delegation (Principle 13)
- Three-role partnership (Principle 18)
- Organizational standards ("Specs as Strategic Assets")

### 4. Tiered Learning

**Tier 1**: Book teaches (hook types, automation patterns)
**Tier 2**: AI Companion creates hooks (THIS lesson)
**Tier 3**: Optional advanced orchestration (20+ hooks, complex workflows)

## Closure Pattern (Lesson Ending)

**Policy**: Single "Try With AI" section, no post-closing sections

**Regenerated Lesson Ending**:

```markdown
## Closing: Automation as Strategic Asset

[Key takeaways, Tier context]

## Try With AI

Pick one exercise and start now:
**Option 1: Discovery** → Exercise 1
**Option 2: Custom Design** → Exercise 2
**Option 3: Implementation** → Exercise 3
```

**Result**: Thematic closure → Action-oriented Try With AI → STOPS

- ✓ No "Key Takeaways" section (consolidated into Closing)
- ✓ No "What's Next" section (not navigation-focused)
- ✓ No post-Try With AI content
- ✓ Single "Try With AI" as final engagement
