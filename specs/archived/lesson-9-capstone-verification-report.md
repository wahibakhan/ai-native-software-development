## I. Constitutional Alignment

### Stage 4 Requirements Met

✅ **Specification Primacy (Principle 1)**

- Lesson emphasizes "write WHAT before HOW"
- Part 2 dedicated entirely to specification-first methodology
- Section "Understanding Specification-First" explains reasoning
- Template provided for students to write their own specification

✅ **Intelligence Composition (Stage 4 Decision Framework)**

- Capstone applies knowledge from Lessons 1-8 (composition, not new concepts)
- Part 1 explicitly maps two paths to prior lessons:
  - Path 1 → Lessons 1-2, Lesson 7 (Custom Commands)
  - Path 2 → Lessons 1-2, Lesson 5, Lesson 6 (Configuration, MCP)
- Part 6 (Reflection) forces students to trace which lessons enabled their capstone

✅ **Specification Quality Framework (IIa.Stage4)**

- Intent clarity: Students write "What I Want to Build" (intent, not implementation)
- Constraint definition: "What I Will NOT Include" section forces non-goals
- Intelligence composition: Students select which tools (from prior lessons) to use
- Self-check: Template includes "read your spec aloud" validation

✅ **Stage Transition Decision Framework (v6.0.0, Section V)**

- Prerequisite validation: Students have completed 8 prior lessons
- Intelligence library: Lessons 1-8 provide components to compose
- Specification capability: Lesson includes validation checklist
- Project complexity: Both paths achievable in 45-60 minutes

### Student-Facing Language Check

✅ **No Internal Scaffolding Labels Exposed**

- Grep check performed: Zero matches for "Stage 4", "Layer 4", "Intelligence Design", "spec-driven" as headers
- Student experiences Stage 4 pedagogy through "Specification-First" language (constitutional requirement)
- Internal stage terminology never appears in student text

---

## II. A2 Complexity Guardrails Verified

### Concept Count Validation

✅ **Concepts: 0 (Capstone applies, doesn't introduce)**

- Metadata: `concepts_count: 0`
- Rationale documented: "Capstone applies and composes prior knowledge without introducing new concepts"

**Concepts NOT introduced**:

- No new command syntax beyond TOML (covered in Lesson 7)
- No new MCP concepts beyond Lesson 6 (configuration only)
- No programming languages or frameworks
- No complex software architecture

**Concepts REUSED from prior lessons**:

- Custom commands (TOML) — Lesson 7
- MCP servers (Playwright) — Lesson 6
- Configuration files (settings.json) — Lesson 5
- Basic Gemini CLI operations — Lessons 1-2

### Cognitive Load Validation

✅ **No Artificial Concept Limits**

- A2 students in Stage 4 capstone don't need new concepts
- Cognitive load entirely from COMPOSITION (applying existing knowledge)
- Two explicit paths: Path 1 (30-45 min) and Path 2 (45-60 min)

✅ **Heavy Scaffolding Appropriate for A2**

- Specification template with detailed placeholders (not blank)
- Example specifications provided (two complete examples)
- Step-by-step implementation guides for both paths
- Validation checklist with clear yes/no criteria
- Common problems with fixes provided

✅ **Two Paths, Not Three+**

- Exactly 2 paths (Path 1: Custom Commands, Path 2: MCP)
- Clear decision framework: "Which Path Should You Choose?"
- Both paths beginner-appropriate

### Time Budget Realistic

✅ **45-60 Minute Window**

- Path 1: 30-45 minutes (TOML configuration only)
- Path 2: 45-60 minutes (includes MCP setup)
- Students given realistic time estimates
- Step-by-step walkthroughs ensure feasibility

### Non-Goals Explicit

✅ **"Complexity Guardrails" Section**

- Section 8 explicitly lists what NOT to include
- ❌ No programming (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript)
- ❌ No API building beyond MCP
- ❌ No deployment or production systems
- ❌ No overcomplicated workflows

---

## V. Specification-First Framework Demonstrated

### Part 2: Writing Your Specification

✅ **Clear Explanation**

- "Why Specifications Come First" section establishes reasoning
- Three explicit reasons: Clarity, Validation, Composition
- Connects to Stage 4 (spec-driven integration)

✅ **Template Provided**

- "My Capstone Specification" template with 7 sections
- Each section has guidance and examples
- Markdown format (easy to copy and use)

✅ **Two Complete Examples**

- Example Spec 1: Study Plan Automation (Path 1)
- Example Spec 2: Research Assistant (Path 2)
- Each example shows expected format and detail level

### Part 3: Specification Validation

✅ **12-Item Validation Checklist**

- Clarity Questions (4 items)
- Completeness Questions (4 items)
- Realism Questions (4 items)
- Scoring guidance: 10-12 "yes" = excellent, 7-9 = good, <7 = needs work

✅ **Common Problems with Fixes**

- Problem 1: Too vague (bad/good examples provided)
- Problem 2: Unmeasurable criteria (bad/good examples)
- Problem 3: Scope too large (bad/good examples)
- Problem 4: Not connected to prior lessons (bad/good examples)

---

## VI. Three Roles Framework (Stage 2 Composition Check)

**Stage 4 Composition Note**: Stage 4 capstone composes Stage 1-3 knowledge. Three Roles (AI Teacher/Student/Co-Worker) not required here — this is capstone applying prior knowledge, not introducing AI collaboration.

However, "Try With AI" section includes bidirectional learning:

✅ **Prompt 1**: AI as Teacher (helps refine spec)
✅ **Prompt 2**: AI as Student (learns from your context, provides debugging help)
✅ **Prompt 3**: AI as Co-Worker (converges on better MCP prompts)
✅ **Prompt 4**: AI as Teacher (provides documentation template)

---

## VII. Evals-First Alignment

### Success Evals for Capstone

**Eval 1**: Students write clear specifications before implementation

- Content mapping: Part 2 (template + examples)
- Validation: Part 3 (checklist forces clarity)
- Assessment: Student produces spec matching all 12 criteria

**Eval 2**: Students can identify which prior lessons enabled their capstone

- Content mapping: Part 6 (Reflection section)
- Validation: 5 explicit reflection questions
- Assessment: Student traces their capstone back to Lessons 1-8

**Eval 3**: Students implement working workflow using spec as guide

- Content mapping: Part 4 (Path 1 and Path 2 implementation)
- Validation: Part 5 (testing templates)
- Assessment: Student's implementation matches their specification

**Eval 4**: Students test against specification success criteria

- Content mapping: Part 5 (validation matrix)
- Validation: Checklist maps each success criterion to test
- Assessment: Student validates all criteria from spec

✅ **100% of content maps to evals** — No tangential bloat

---

## VIII. Anti-Convergence Verification

### Teaching Modality Variation

✅ **This lesson varies from Lesson 8**:

- Lesson 8 (Extensions): Direct teaching with examples
- Lesson 9 (Capstone): Specification-first with student design
- Different pedagogical approach prevents convergence

✅ **Within-Chapter Modality Variation**:

- Lessons 1-2: Direct teaching (Manual Foundation)
- Lessons 3-5: Guided exploration (Tools, memory, config)
- Lessons 6-7: Hands-on practice (MCP, commands)
- Lesson 8: Direct teaching with examples (Extensions)
- Lesson 9: Spec-first design (Capstone integration)

### Example Quality Check

✅ **Production-Relevant, Not Toy Examples**

- Path 1: `/study-plan` command (solves real learning problem)
- Path 2: Research assistant (used for actual research needs)
- Both examples solve genuine student needs, not toy projects

✅ **Reusable After Capstone**

- Students will use these workflows repeatedly
- Workflows can be shared with study partners
- Workflows can be extended into extensions (Lesson 8)

### Cognitive Engagement Check

✅ **Forcing Active Reasoning, Not Passive Reading**

- Specification writing forces design decisions
- Validation checklist requires critical thinking
- Reflection forces tracing back to prior lessons
- Testing requires verification against criteria
