## Follow-Up Tasks & Risks

### Identified Risks

- **Risk 1: Tool Version Creep**

  - **Impact**: Zed/Ruff/Pyright release breaking changes; examples become outdated
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (tools actively developed)
  - **Mitigation**: Version pins in all examples; update triggers documented (Section VI.B Constitution)
  - **Action**: Set review date Q3 2025 (3-month refresh cycle)

- **Risk 2: Platform-Specific Issues**

  - **Impact**: Installation fails on Windows/Linux; students stuck
  - **Likelihood**: Low (Zed/Ruff/Pyright all cross-platform)
  - **Mitigation**: Test on three platforms; document workarounds
  - **Action**: Request tester for Windows/Linux before publication

- **Risk 3: LSP Configuration Complexity**
  - **Impact**: Students struggle with Zed settings.json; LSP doesn't start
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (configuration is notoriously finicky)
  - **Mitigation**: Detailed troubleshooting checklist (Lesson 11); AI examples show how to ask for help
  - **Action**: Include pre-made settings.json in template (Lesson 12)

### Next Steps (After Phase 7)

1. **Phase 8: Validation** (Technical Review)

   - Invoke `validation-auditor` subagent to verify code examples
   - Run sandbox tests on all commands
   - Verify against Success Criteria (SC-001 through SC-012 from spec.md)

2. **Phase 9: Proof Validation** (Final QA)

   - Invoke `factual-verifier` for final quality gate
   - Check all files written to correct locations
   - Verify chapter builds in Docusaurus

3. **Phase 10: Publication**
   - Human final review
   - Merge to main branch
   - Build and test full book
   - Publish to web
