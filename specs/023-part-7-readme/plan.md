# Implementation Plan: Part 7 README — AI Cloud Native Development

**Branch**: `023-part-7-readme` | **Date**: 2025-11-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/023-part-7-readme/spec.md`

## Summary

Create Part 7 README that positions the 12-chapter section as a bridge from "building agents locally" (Parts 1-6) to "deploying at production scale." README will preview chapter progression (FastAPI → containerization → orchestration → Dapr → operations), explain the extended 7-layer methodology for infrastructure (kubectl → kubectl-ai → kagent → Claude Code → Helm → subagents → SDD), and set expectations for production operations focus (observability, cost engineering, security).

**Target audience**: Developers completing Part 6 (B1-B2 tier, can build agents locally, understand spec-driven development)
**Target length**: 75-90 lines (6-8 sections)
**Tone**: Bridge from development to DevOps/SRE practices

## Technical Context

**Document Type**: Educational documentation (Part-level README)
**Format**: Markdown with Docusaurus frontmatter
**Template Reference**: Part 6 README (`apps/learn-app/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/README.md`)
**Target Location**: `apps/learn-app/docs/07-AI-Cloud-Native-Development/README.md`
**Content Sources**:

- Chapter-index.md (Part 7 chapters 50-61 descriptions)
- Part 6 README (structural pattern)
- Constitution.md (B1-B2 tier guidelines, anti-convergence principle)

**Performance Goals**: N/A (static documentation)
**Constraints**:

- 75-90 lines (flexibility for 7-layer framework explanation)
- 6-8 sections following Part 6 pattern
- Docusaurus-compatible markdown syntax

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Educational documentation guidelines from constitution v6.0.0_

### Applicable Principles

✅ **Principle 1 (Specification Primacy)**: README positions WHAT Part 7 accomplishes (deployment at scale) before listing chapters (HOW)

✅ **Principle 2 (Progressive Complexity)**: B1-B2 tier content, ~7-10 key concepts with moderate scaffolding

✅ **Principle 3 (Factual Accuracy)**: All infrastructure claims must be verifiable (Docker, Kubernetes, Dapr patterns)

✅ **Principle 4 (Coherent Structure)**: Follows pedagogical progression (Overview → Goals → Chapter Progression → Methodology → Capstone → Getting Started)

✅ **Principle 5 (Intelligence Accumulation)**: Build on Part 6 README pattern, reference Parts 1-6 accomplishments

✅ **Principle 6 (Anti-Convergence)**: Part 6 used "thematic stages" structure → Part 7 uses "capability progression" or "infrastructure layers"

✅ **Principle 7 (Minimal Content)**: Every section justifies presence for learning orientation, no exhaustive DevOps tutorials

### Stage Framework Application

**NOT APPLICABLE**: Part-level READMEs are documentation, not lesson content. 4-Stage teaching framework (Manual → AI Collaboration → Intelligence Design → Spec-Driven) does not apply.

**Note**: Individual Part 7 _chapters_ (50-61) will apply 4-stage or 7-layer frameworks as appropriate. The README _describes_ these frameworks but doesn't teach through them.

### Gates Status

- ✅ **Gate 1**: README is documentation (not lesson), no stage progression required
- ✅ **Gate 2**: B1-B2 complexity tier appropriate for Part 6 graduates
- ✅ **Gate 3**: Anti-convergence addressed (vary from Part 6's thematic stages structure)
- ✅ **Gate 4**: Minimal content principle (orientation only, no exhaustive tutorials)

**Verdict**: **PASS** — All applicable constitutional principles satisfied for documentation task

## Documentation Structure

### Target Sections (6-8 sections, following Part 6 pattern)

```markdown
# Part 7: AI Cloud Native Development

## Overview

[Positioning paragraph: local development → production deployment bridge]
[Target audience: Part 6 graduates]
[Value proposition: deployment knowledge necessary for production agents]

## Goals

[Bullet list: capabilities developers gain]

- Understand agent deployment architectures
- Implement containerization strategies
- Apply orchestration patterns (Kubernetes, Dapr)
- Design operational excellence (observability, cost, security)

## Chapter Progression

[Thematic grouping of 12 chapters with sequence rationale]

### Foundational Infrastructure (Chapters 50-52)

- Ch 50: FastAPI deep-dive
- Ch 51: Docker containerization
- Ch 52: Apache Kafka (event-driven patterns)

### Orchestration (Chapters 53-54)

- Ch 53: Kubernetes for AI services
- Ch 54: CI/CD and Infrastructure-as-Code

### Dapr Framework (Chapters 55-58)

- Ch 55: Dapr for microservices
- Ch 56: Dapr Actors for state
- Ch 57: Dapr Workflows for orchestration
- Ch 58: Dapr Agents design

### Operations Excellence (Chapters 59-61)

- Ch 59: Observability, cost, performance
- Ch 60: API edge and gateway
- Ch 61: Security, safety, governance

**Why this sequence?** Foundation → Orchestration → Framework → Operations

## Extended Methodology Note

[7-layer framework explanation per FR-003 Expanded]

### Layer Comparison Table

| 4-Layer Method (Parts 1-6)       | 7-Layer Framework (Part 7 Kubernetes)   | Rationale                                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Layer 1: Manual Foundation       | Layers 1-2: kubectl manual + kubectl-ai | CLI tools need manual + AI-assisted practice   |
| Layer 2: AI Collaboration        | Layers 3-4: kagent + Claude Code        | Agents at different abstraction levels         |
| Layer 3: Intelligence Design     | Layers 5-6: Helm charts + subagents     | Infrastructure has config + agent intelligence |
| Layer 4: Spec-Driven Integration | Layer 7: SDD for infrastructure         | Spec-driven applies to infrastructure          |

[Rationale paragraph]
[Application guidance: Kubernetes uses 7 layers, Dapr uses 4 layers]

## Capstone Expectations

[Production operations focus]
[Include: observability configs, cost analysis, security configurations]
[Not just: basic deployment]

## Getting Started

[Begin with Chapter 50: FastAPI deep-dive]
[Prerequisites: Parts 4-5 required, Part 6 strongly recommended]
```

**Estimated Length**: 85 lines (within 75-90 target)

## Content Requirements Mapping

### From Spec to Sections

**FR-001** (Position as bridge) → **Overview section**

- Opening paragraph: "You've built agents locally in Parts 1-6. Part 7 teaches production deployment at scale."

**FR-002** (Preview chapter progression) → **Chapter Progression section**

- 4 thematic groups: Foundation (50-52) → Orchestration (53-54) → Dapr (55-58) → Operations (59-61)

**FR-003 Expanded** (7-layer framework) → **Extended Methodology Note section**

- Positioning statement
- Layer comparison table (4-layer vs 7-layer)
- Rationale explanation
- Application guidance (Kubernetes vs Dapr)

**FR-004** (Production operations expectations) → **Capstone Expectations section**

- List operational concerns: observability, cost engineering, security
- Contrast with "just getting Docker running"

**FR-005** (Prerequisites) → **Getting Started section**

- Parts 4-5 required (Python, SDD)
- Part 6 strongly recommended (agent building)

**FR-006** (Scope boundaries) → **Overview section**

- Part 7 = infrastructure/deployment
- Part 8 = custom model training (reference forward)

**FR-007** (Tone: bridge from dev to ops) → **All sections**

- Approachable language for developers new to ops
- Introduce operations concepts (don't assume expertise)

**FR-008** (Follow Part 6 pattern) → **Structure**

- 6 sections minimum (Overview, Goals, Chapter Progression, Methodology, Capstone, Getting Started)
- Optional 7th-8th sections if needed

## Complexity Tracking

**No constitutional violations to justify** — Documentation task aligns with all applicable principles.

### Anti-Convergence Strategy

**Part 6 README used**: Thematic stages structure (Agent Frameworks → Integration → Implementation → Quality → Patterns → Data)

**Part 7 README will use**: Capability progression structure (Foundation → Orchestration → Framework → Operations)

**Variation rationale**:

- Part 6 organized by _technical concern_ (frameworks, integration, quality)
- Part 7 organizes by _deployment capability_ (can containerize → can orchestrate → can operate)
- Both are logical, neither is "better" — variation prevents convergence

## Phase 0: Content Research

### Research Tasks

**No external research required** — All content sources are internal:

1. ✅ **Chapter descriptions**: Available in `specs/book/chapter-index.md` (chapters 50-61)
2. ✅ **Structural pattern**: Available in `apps/learn-app/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/README.md`
3. ✅ **7-layer framework**: Specified in spec.md FR-003 Expanded (comparison table defined)
4. ✅ **Constitutional guidelines**: Available in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Research output**: N/A (documentation task, no technical unknowns)

- Prerequisites: Parts 4-5 required, Part 6 strongly recommended
- Note for experienced DevOps: Novel content in Dapr chapters (55-58)

**Total Estimated**: 72-90 lines ✅ (within 75-90 target)

### Data Model

**N/A** — Documentation has no data entities

### Contracts

**N/A** — Documentation has no API contracts

### Quickstart

**N/A** — README itself is quickstart for Part 7 (Getting Started section)

## Implementation Notes

### Tone Examples (from spec)

**✅ GOOD** (approachable bridge):

> "Part 7 introduces production operations concepts—observability, cost engineering, security—that you may not have encountered if your background is primarily development. These chapters assume no prior DevOps expertise."

**❌ AVOID** (assumes ops expertise):

> "Part 7 covers cloud-native operations. You should already be familiar with Prometheus, Grafana, and cost allocation strategies from prior SRE experience."

### Section Ordering Logic

1. **Overview** → Orients learner (where am I, what will I gain?)
2. **Goals** → Specific capabilities (what can I do after completion?)
3. **Chapter Progression** → Learning path (how do concepts build?)
4. **Methodology Note** → Teaching approach (7-layer framework for infrastructure)
5. **Capstone Expectations** → Project scope (production operations, not just deployment)
6. **Getting Started** → First steps (Chapter 50, prerequisites check)

**Rationale**: Broad context → Specific outcomes → Detailed map → Methodology → Assessment → Action
