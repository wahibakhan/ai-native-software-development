# Feature Specification: Part 7 README — AI Cloud Native Development

**Feature Branch**: `023-part-7-readme`
**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "Create Part 7 README (AI Cloud Native Development, 12 chapters). Target: developers who completed Parts 1-6. Goals: (1) position Part 7 as transition from building agents to deploying at scale, (2) preview chapter progression, (3) clarify extended layer methodology for infrastructure, (4) set expectations for production operations focus."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Understanding Part 7's Purpose and Value (Priority: P1)

A developer who has completed Parts 1-6 (can build agents locally, understands spec-driven development) opens Part 7's README to determine if they're ready to proceed and what new capabilities they'll gain.

**Why this priority**: Without clear positioning, developers may skip Part 7 thinking it's optional DevOps content, missing the critical bridge from local development to production deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a Part 6 graduate: "After reading this README, can you explain in one sentence what Part 7 teaches and why it matters for your agent development?"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer completed Part 6 (builds agents locally), **When** reading overview section, **Then** understands Part 7 teaches production deployment at scale (not just "DevOps basics")
2. **Given** developer unfamiliar with DevOps/SRE, **When** reading goals section, **Then** recognizes Part 7 bridges development practices to operations concerns
3. **Given** developer considering skipping Part 7, **When** reading prerequisites and positioning, **Then** understands deployment knowledge is necessary for production agent systems

---

### User Story 2 - Navigating Chapter Progression with Clear Learning Path (Priority: P1)

A developer planning their learning journey needs to understand how Part 7's 12 chapters build from foundational infrastructure (FastAPI, Docker) through orchestration (Kubernetes, Dapr) to operational excellence (observability, security).

**Why this priority**: Without clear progression mapping, developers may jump to advanced topics (Kubernetes) without foundations (containerization), leading to confusion and gaps.

**Independent Test**: Developer can answer: "Which chapters do I need before tackling Dapr Agents (Chapter 58)?" and "Why does FastAPI deep-dive come before Docker?"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer wants to learn Kubernetes for agents, **When** reading chapter progression section, **Then** understands prerequisite path (FastAPI → Docker → Kubernetes → Dapr)
2. **Given** developer familiar with Docker but not Dapr, **When** reviewing chapter descriptions, **Then** knows which chapters to focus on (53-58, 60-61) vs which to skim (51-52)
3. **Given** developer unsure about Kafka/event-driven patterns, **When** reading chapter summaries, **Then** recognizes Chapter 52 as optional (event-driven architecture) vs core deployment path

---

### User Story 3 - Understanding Extended Layer Methodology for Infrastructure (Priority: P2)

A developer trained on the 4-layer teaching method (Manual → AI Collaboration → Intelligence Design → Spec-Driven) needs to understand how this extends to infrastructure tooling, specifically the 7-layer Kubernetes framework mentioned in the user request.

**Why this priority**: Part 7 introduces infrastructure-specific methodology (7-layer framework for kubectl → kubectl-ai → kagent → claude code → Helm → subagents → SDD). Without explanation, developers may apply 4-layer thinking inappropriately to ops tooling.

**Independent Test**: Developer can explain the difference: "Why does Kubernetes need 7 layers instead of 4?" and map layers to specific tools/workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer familiar with 4-layer method from Parts 1-6, **When** reading methodology section, **Then** understands infrastructure adds 3 layers (kubectl-ai, Helm, specific orchestration tools)
2. **Given** developer working through Kubernetes chapter (53), **When** referencing README methodology notes, **Then** applies appropriate layer framework (7-layer, not 4-layer)
3. **Given** developer designing reusable infrastructure intelligence, **When** reading extended methodology, **Then** knows when to create Helm charts vs subagents vs SDD specifications

---

### User Story 4 - Setting Realistic Production Operations Expectations (Priority: P2)

A developer entering Part 7 needs to understand that this part emphasizes production operations (observability, cost engineering, security) rather than just "getting agents running in Docker."

**Why this priority**: Prevents expectation mismatch. Developers expecting quick Docker tutorials may be surprised by deep operational topics (cost optimization, security governance, observability strategies).

**Independent Test**: Developer can list three operational concerns covered in Part 7 beyond basic deployment (e.g., observability, cost engineering, API gateway patterns).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer thinks "cloud deployment = Docker + Kubernetes," **When** reading operations focus section, **Then** recognizes Part 7 covers observability (Chapter 59), security (Chapter 61), and cost engineering
2. **Given** developer planning capstone project, **When** reviewing expectations section, **Then** understands capstones include monitoring, cost analysis, and security configurations (not just deployment)
3. **Given** developer with no DevOps background, **When** reading prerequisites, **Then** knows Part 7 introduces operations concepts (not assumes prior ops experience)

---

### Edge Cases

- What if developer skipped Parts 4-5 (Python fundamentals, SDD) but wants to learn cloud deployment?
  → Prerequisites section must explicitly state Parts 4-5 are required (agents written in Python, SDD methodology assumed)

- What if developer completed Part 6 but has strong existing DevOps expertise?
  → README should indicate which chapters offer novel content (Dapr for AI, agent-specific patterns) vs standard ops practices

- What if developer confuses Part 7 (cloud-native deployment) with Part 8 (Turing LLMOps)?
  → Clear boundaries: Part 7 = infrastructure/deployment, Part 8 = custom model training/fine-tuning

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: README MUST position Part 7 as the bridge from "building agents locally" (Parts 1-6) to "deploying agents at production scale" (Part 7)
- **FR-002**: README MUST preview the 12-chapter progression: FastAPI deep-dive (50) → containerization (51-52) → orchestration (53-54) → Dapr (55-58) → operations (59-61)
- **FR-003**: README MUST explain the extended layer methodology for infrastructure, specifically the 7-layer Kubernetes framework: kubectl → kubectl-ai → kagent → claude code → Helm → subagents → SDD
- **FR-004**: README MUST set expectations for production operations focus (observability, cost engineering, security) beyond basic deployment
- **FR-005**: README MUST identify prerequisites (Parts 1-6 completion, especially Parts 4-5 for Python and SDD)
- **FR-006**: README MUST clarify Part 7's scope boundaries: infrastructure/deployment (included) vs custom model training (excluded, see Part 8)
- **FR-007**: README MUST maintain tone as "bridge from development to DevOps/SRE practices" (approachable for developers new to ops, not assuming ops expertise)
- **FR-008**: README MUST follow established Part README pattern (see Part 6 README structure: Overview → Goals → Chapter Progression → Methodology Note → Capstone Expectations → Getting Started)

### FR-003 Expanded: 7-Layer Framework Explanation Requirements

The README's 7-layer framework explanation (Extended Methodology section) MUST include:

1. **Positioning statement**: "Infrastructure tooling requires an extended methodology beyond the 4-layer teaching method you've used in Parts 1-6."

2. **Layer comparison table** (4-layer vs 7-layer):

   | 4-Layer Method (Parts 1-6)       | 7-Layer Framework (Part 7 Kubernetes)   | Rationale                                                                       |
   | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Layer 1: Manual Foundation       | Layers 1-2: kubectl manual + kubectl-ai | CLI tools need both manual practice and AI-assisted variations                  |
   | Layer 2: AI Collaboration        | Layers 3-4: kagent + Claude Code        | Agents operate at different abstraction levels (imperative vs declarative)      |
   | Layer 3: Intelligence Design     | Layers 5-6: Helm charts + subagents     | Infrastructure has two intelligence types: configs (Helm) and autonomous agents |
   | Layer 4: Spec-Driven Integration | Layer 7: SDD for infrastructure         | Spec-driven methodology applies to infrastructure orchestration                 |

3. **Rationale explanation** (1-2 sentences): "Infrastructure tooling has more abstraction layers (raw CLI → AI-assisted CLI → orchestrating agents → reusable configurations) than application code, requiring finer-grained teaching progression to build competence at each level."

4. **Application guidance**:

   - "Kubernetes chapters (53-54) use the full 7-layer framework due to infrastructure complexity"
   - "Dapr chapters (55-58) simplify to 4 layers since Dapr operates at application level, not infrastructure level"
   - "FastAPI and Docker chapters use standard 4-layer method with infrastructure adaptations"

5. **Student self-assessment question**: "When working through Kubernetes chapter, ask yourself: 'Which layer am I on? Manual kubectl (L1), kubectl-ai (L2), kagent (L3), Claude Code (L4), Helm (L5), subagents (L6), or SDD (L7)?'"

**Acceptance Criteria for FR-003**:

- Developer can answer: "Why does Kubernetes infrastructure need 7 layers when FastAPI only needed 4?" (answer: "Infrastructure has more abstraction layers requiring finer-grained progression")
- Developer can correctly match a tool to its layer (e.g., "Helm is Layer 5: reusable configuration intelligence")
- Developer recognizes chapter-specific application: "Dapr uses 4 layers, not 7, since it's application-level"

### Key Entities _(documentation structure)_

- **Part 7 Overview**: Positioning statement, target audience, value proposition
- **Goals Section**: Specific capabilities developers gain (understand agent deployment architectures, implement container strategies, apply orchestration patterns, design operational excellence)
- **Chapter Progression Section**: Thematic grouping of 12 chapters with rationale for sequence
- **Extended Methodology Section**: 7-layer framework explanation with infrastructure-specific teaching approach (following FR-003 Expanded requirements above)
- **Capstone Expectations**: Production operations focus (observability, cost, security) in final projects
- **Prerequisites Section**: Parts 4-5 required, Parts 1-3 recommended, Part 6 strongly recommended

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers completing Part 6 can read README and accurately identify Part 7's focus (cloud-native deployment vs local development) in under 3 minutes
- **SC-002**: 90% of developers reading chapter progression section can correctly sequence prerequisite chapters (e.g., "I need Docker before Kubernetes")
- **SC-003**: Developers can explain one infrastructure-specific methodology difference (e.g., "Kubernetes uses 7-layer framework, not 4-layer") after reading methodology section
- **SC-004**: Developers planning Part 7 capstones include at least one operational concern (observability, cost, or security) after reading expectations section
- **SC-005**: README aligns structurally with existing Part READMEs (Part 3, Part 6 patterns) for consistent learner experience
- **SC-006**: Zero developers attempt Part 7 without completing Parts 4-5 after reading prerequisites (verifiable through prerequisite validation)

## Assumptions

1. **Audience tier**: Developers completing Part 6 are B1-B2 level (intermediate to upper-intermediate) with Python fundamentals and SDD experience
2. **Infrastructure tooling**: Chapters assume Docker, Kubernetes, Dapr as primary tools (industry-standard cloud-native stack)
3. **7-layer framework**: Kubernetes-specific progression (kubectl → kubectl-ai → kagent → claude code → Helm → subagents → SDD) represents extension of 4-layer teaching method for infrastructure context
4. **Operations scope**: Part 7 covers deployment operations (observability, cost, security) but NOT custom model operations (fine-tuning, model serving covered in Part 8)
5. **Tone balance**: "Bridge from development to DevOps/SRE" means introducing ops concepts to developers (not teaching experienced SREs)

## Non-Goals

- **NG-001**: README will NOT provide exhaustive DevOps tutorials (chapters contain detailed content, README orients)
- **NG-002**: README will NOT compare cloud providers (AWS vs Azure vs GCP) — chapters present provider-agnostic patterns
- **NG-003**: README will NOT teach Docker/Kubernetes basics from scratch — assumes chapters 51-53 cover foundations, README previews progression
- **NG-004**: README will NOT cover custom model training, fine-tuning, or LLMOps (Part 8 scope, not Part 7)
- **NG-005**: README will NOT assume DevOps expertise — introduces operations concepts as new material for developers

## Constraints

- **CON-001**: README must follow existing Part README structural pattern (6-8 sections: Overview, Goals, Chapter Progression, Methodology, Capstone, Getting Started)
- **CON-002**: README length should approximate Part 6 README (~75 lines) for consistency, with flexibility (+15 lines) to accommodate Part 7's additional methodology explanation (7-layer framework). Target: 75-90 lines, 6-8 sections.
- **CON-003**: Markdown formatting must use Docusaurus-compatible syntax (frontmatter, headings, lists)
- **CON-004**: File location: `apps/learn-app/docs/07-AI-Cloud-Native-Development/README.md` (following Part 1-6 convention)
- **CON-005**: Tone must balance technical accuracy with approachability for developers new to operations

## Open Questions

_No critical ambiguities requiring clarification. All requirements derivable from:_

- User request (explicit goals 1-4, tone specification)
- Chapter-index.md (Part 7 = Chapters 50-61, thematic groups)
- Existing Part READMEs (structural pattern from Parts 3, 6)
- Constitutional principles (B1-B2 tier, anti-convergence from Part 6 pattern)
