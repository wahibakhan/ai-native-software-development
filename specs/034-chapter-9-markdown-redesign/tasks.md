# Tasks: Chapter 9 Markdown Redesign - Specification Language Approach

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/034-chapter-9-markdown-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (lesson breakdown), spec.md (user stories and requirements)
**Target Directory**: `apps/learn-app/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/09-markdown-language-of-ai/`

**Tests**: Not applicable for educational content (quality validation through validation-auditor agent instead)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by lesson (user story equivalent) to enable independent lesson implementation and validation.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (e.g., L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Chapter directory**: `apps/learn-app/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/09-markdown-language-of-ai/`
- **Lesson files**: `01-lesson-title.md`, `02-lesson-title.md`, etc.
- **Chapter README**: `README.md` in chapter directory

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Chapter Structure)

**Purpose**: Initialize chapter directory structure and validate prerequisites

- [ ] T001 Validate chapter directory exists at `apps/learn-app/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/09-markdown-language-of-ai/`
- [ ] T002 Read existing README.md to preserve chapter overview structure
- [ ] T003 Read existing lesson 04-code-blocks.md to identify content that violates no-code constraint (Python/Bash examples)
- [ ] T004 [P] Backup existing lessons to `specs/034-chapter-9-markdown-redesign/backup/` directory

**Checkpoint**: Directory structure validated, existing content analyzed

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Chapter-Level Updates)

**Purpose**: Update chapter-level documentation and establish teaching framework

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These tasks establish the specification-first modality for ALL lessons

- [ ] T005 Update README.md with new chapter overview (specification language focus, 5-lesson structure, no-code constraint)
- [ ] T006 [P] Document lesson ending protocol: ONLY "Try With AI" section permitted (no "What's Next", "Key Takeaways", "Summary")
- [ ] T007 [P] Create constitutional compliance checklist in `specs/034-chapter-9-markdown-redesign/validation-checklist.md`

**Checkpoint**: Chapter framework established - lesson implementation can now begin in parallel

- [ ] T084 Run final quality check using validation-auditor agent

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all lesson implementation
- **Lessons (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Lessons can then proceed in parallel (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 are independent files)
  - Or sequentially in order (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5 for pedagogical coherence)
- **Validation (Phase 8)**: Depends on ALL lessons being complete
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on Validation completion

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (L1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other lessons
- **Lesson 2 (L2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on L1 conceptually but file is independent
- **Lesson 3 (L3)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on L2 conceptually but file is independent
- **Lesson 4 (L4)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on L1-L3 conceptually but file is independent
- **Lesson 5 (L5)**: Can start after Foundational - Composes L1-L4 but file is independent

### Within Each Lesson

- Introduction section before concept sections
- Concept sections before practice exercises
- Practice exercises before "Try With AI"
- "Try With AI" MUST be final section
- Frontmatter validation after content complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all 5 lessons can be written in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All validation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 8)
- All polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 9)

---

## Parallel Example: Lesson Implementation

```bash
# After Foundational phase complete, launch all lessons in parallel:
Task: "Create 01-markdown-as-specification-language.md" [L1]
Task: "Create 02-lists-for-requirements.md" [L2]
Task: "Create 03-code-blocks-for-specifications.md" [L3]
Task: "Create 04-links-images-and-templates.md" [L4]
Task: "Create 05-complete-system-specification.md" [L5]

# Or validation tasks in parallel:
Task: "Run grep validation for code patterns" [P]
Task: "Validate lesson ending protocol" [P]
Task: "Validate concept counts in frontmatter" [P]
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Approach (Recommended for Pedagogical Coherence)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - establishes teaching framework)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 1 (Foundation)
4. Complete Phase 4: Lesson 2 (AI Collaboration starts)
5. Complete Phase 5: Lesson 3 (AI Collaboration deepens)
6. Complete Phase 6: Lesson 4 (Intelligence Design)
7. Complete Phase 7: Lesson 5 (Capstone)
8. Complete Phase 8: Validation
9. Complete Phase 9: Polish

**Why sequential?** Each lesson builds conceptually on previous lessons. Testing progression ensures coherent learning pathway.

### Parallel Approach (If Multiple Content Authors Available)

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Author A: Lesson 1 + Lesson 2
   - Author B: Lesson 3 + Lesson 4
   - Author C: Lesson 5 + Validation
3. Team reviews for consistency
4. Complete Polish together

---

## Notes

### Task Labeling

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies
- **[Lesson]** label maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- Each lesson should be independently completable once Foundational phase is complete

### Quality Gates

- **After each lesson**: Run grep validation to catch code examples early
- **After Phase 8**: Full constitutional compliance validation before polish
- **Before completion**: Run validation-auditor agent for comprehensive quality check

### Constitutional Compliance Reminders

- **Forbidden**: Code examples (Python, Bash, JavaScript, any programming syntax)
- **Forbidden**: Sections after "Try With AI" (no "What's Next", "Key Takeaways")
- **Forbidden**: Internal labels in student-facing text ("Stage 1/2/3/4", "Three Roles Framework")
- **Required**: Specification examples ONLY (feature lists, acceptance criteria, expected outputs)
- **Required**: A2 tier cognitive load (5-7 concepts per section, maximum 7 with scaffolding)
- **Required**: Three Roles demonstrated in Lessons 2-3 through narrative
- **Required**: Persona + Questions + Principles pattern in Lesson 4 template
- **Required**: Capstone composition in Lesson 5 (uses all markdown skills)

### Anti-Pattern Detection

- Watch for: Code-centric language ("implement this", "run this code")
- Watch for: Generic markdown tutorial language ("make pretty READMEs")
- Watch for: Missing specification context in code blocks
- Ensure: Specification-first language ("describe WHAT system does", "communicate intent to AI")
