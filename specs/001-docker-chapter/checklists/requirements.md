# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 49 - Docker for AI Services

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Updated**: 2025-12-22 (Revised to 9-lesson structure)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (8 total)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS

1. **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT (containerize agent) not HOW (specific Python code patterns). Technology mentions (Docker, Scout, Gordon) are tools students USE, not implementation details.

2. **User value focus**: Every user story starts with learner need ("works on my machine" → "works everywhere").

3. **Non-technical readability**: Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format accessible to stakeholders.

4. **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities all present.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

1. **No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers**: Section "Open Questions" explicitly states no critical clarifications needed.

2. **Testable requirements**: All 42 FRs use action verbs ("Student MUST be able to...") with observable outcomes.

3. **Measurable success criteria**: SC-001 through SC-010 include percentages, times, and survey measures.

4. **Technology-agnostic criteria**: SC-001 says "install Docker and run hello-world within 30 minutes" - measurable without implementation details.

5. **Acceptance scenarios**: 7 user stories (P0, P1, P1.5, P2x3, P3x2) with 24 total acceptance scenarios.

6. **Edge cases**: 8 edge cases identified with solutions (added "Container won't start").

7. **Scope bounded**: Clear "Non-Goals" section with 10 explicit exclusions.

8. **Dependencies**: Part 6 prerequisite, Docker Desktop requirements documented.

### Feature Readiness - PASS

1. **FR acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to user story acceptance scenarios. FRs organized by lesson (9 lessons).

2. **Primary flows covered**: P0 (installation), P1 (containerization, debugging), P2 (optimization, compose, security), P3 (AI-assist, registry).

3. **Measurable outcomes**: 10 success criteria with quantitative targets.

4. **No implementation leak**: Technology context section describes 2025 updates but doesn't dictate implementation.

## Final Status

**CHECKLIST COMPLETE**: All items pass validation.

**Ready for**: `/sp.plan` (recommended)

## Revision History

### v2 (2025-12-22) - 9-Lesson Structure
Based on learning sciences feedback:
- **Added Lesson 1**: Docker Installation & Setup (was implicit)
- **Added Lesson 4**: Container Lifecycle & Debugging (missing "operate before optimize" step)
- **Added User Story 0** (P0): Installation and verification
- **Added User Story 1.5** (P1): Debug and operate containers
- **Updated FRs**: 42 total (was 26), organized by 9 lessons
- **Updated SCs**: 10 total (was 8), added SC-001 (installation) and SC-003 (debugging)
- **Key principle applied**: "You must be able to run and debug containers before you can optimize them"

### v1 (2025-12-22) - Initial 8-Lesson Structure
- Original specification with 8 lessons
- Identified gap between "Writing Dockerfile" and "Multi-Stage Builds"

## Notes

- Spec incorporates December 2025 Docker Hardened Images announcement
- Learning sciences decision documented (no separate cloud intro chapter)
- **Revised to 9-lesson structure** addressing cognitive gap
- Reference format: Gemini CLI chapter (03-built-in-tools-deep-dive.md)
- AI-assisted workflows (Gordon) integrated as Lesson 8 with Three Roles framework (INVISIBLE)
