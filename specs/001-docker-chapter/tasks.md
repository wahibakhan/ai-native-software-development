## CRITICAL: Pre-Implementation Study Requirements

**Before writing ANY lesson content, the implementing agent MUST:**

### 1. Study Docker Domain Knowledge (MANDATORY)

**Primary Reference**: `cloud-books/docker_deep_dive.md` (Nigel Poulton, 2024)
- This is the authoritative Docker reference - read relevant chapters before writing each lesson
- Cross-reference with official Docker docs for 2025 updates

**Official Documentation** (fetch as needed):
- Docker Get Started: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
- Docker Hardened Images: https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hardened-images/
- Docker Scout: https://docs.docker.com/scout/
- Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

### 2. Study the Reference Format (MANDATORY)

Read and internalize the structure from these reference lessons:

```
apps/learn-app/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/03-built-in-tools-deep-dive.md
```

**Extract and follow**:
- YAML frontmatter structure (learning objectives, CEFR level, cognitive load, Bloom's level)
- Section organization pattern
- "Try With AI" section format (action prompts, NOT meta-commentary)
- Code block formatting conventions
- Exercise structure

### 3. Study the Constitution (MANDATORY)

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v6.0.1) focusing on:
- Section IIa: 4-Layer Teaching Method
- Section IIa: Three Roles Framework (must be INVISIBLE in student content)
- Section IIa: Meta-Commentary Prohibition (forbidden patterns)
- Section III: 7 Foundational Principles

### 4. Study the Chapter Specification

Read `specs/001-docker-chapter/spec.md` for:
- User Stories and acceptance scenarios
- Functional requirements per lesson
- Success criteria targets
- Technology context (DHI, Scout, Gordon, etc.)

### 5. Study the Chapter Plan

Read `specs/001-docker-chapter/plan.md` for:
- Per-lesson learning objectives
- Concepts inventory per lesson
- Teaching modality per lesson
- Exercise specifications

**Validation**: Before starting Phase 3 (Lesson 1), agent should be able to answer:
- What is the difference between an image and a container? (Docker Deep Dive Ch 6-7)
- What are Docker Hardened Images and why use them? (2025 update)
- What YAML frontmatter fields are required?
- What does a "Try With AI" section look like (correct format)?
- What patterns are FORBIDDEN in student-facing content?
- What teaching modality does each lesson use?

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (L1, L2, L3, etc.)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Lesson files**: `apps/learn-app/docs/07-AI-Cloud-Native-Development/49-docker-for-ai-services/`
- **Assets**: `apps/learn-app/docs/07-AI-Cloud-Native-Development/49-docker-for-ai-services/assets/`

**Skill Structure Template**:
```markdown

    name: "production-dockerfile"
    description: "Create production-ready multi-stage Dockerfiles. Use when containerizing Python/FastAPI applications for deployment."
    version: "1.0.0"
    ---

    ## Persona
    Think like a DevOps engineer who prioritizes: security (non-root, minimal CVEs),
    efficiency (small images, fast builds), and maintainability (clear layer structure).

    ## Questions (analyze before generating)
    1. What's the application type? (FastAPI, CLI, worker, etc.)
    2. What dependencies exist? (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, poetry)
    3. Are there large files (>100MB) that should be volume-mounted?
    4. What's the target environment? (cloud, local dev, CI)
    5. Are there security requirements? (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)

    ## Principles
    - Base image: DHI (`dhi.io/python:3.12`) unless specific reason for alternative
    - User: Non-root (UID 1000) always
    - Dependencies: UV for speed, copy lock files before code for caching
    - Health: HEALTHCHECK instruction required
    - Size target: <400MB for typical FastAPI apps
```

**Checkpoint**: Lesson 10 complete - students have created reusable Docker skill that compounds across projects

## Phase 13: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns — [#369](https://github.com/panaversity/ai-native-software-development/issues/369)

**Purpose**: Final validation and chapter-wide improvements
**Close Issue**: `gh issue close 369` when complete

- [ ] T125 [P] Validate all lessons against constitution v6.0.1 (Three Roles invisible, no meta-commentary)
- [ ] T126 [P] Validate YAML frontmatter consistency across all lessons
- [ ] T127 [P] Validate concept counts per lesson (4-7 within B1-B2 limits)
- [ ] T128 [P] Run grep validation: `grep -i "What to notice\|AI.*teach\|AI as" *.md`
- [ ] T129 [P] Validate lesson cross-references and prerequisites
- [ ] T130 [P] Create chapter summary statistics (total concepts, total exercises, total duration)
- [ ] T131 Update chapter README with final 10-lesson list and learning outcomes

**Checkpoint**: Chapter 49 complete and validated

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Study (Phase 0)**: No dependencies - START HERE. Agent studies book format before writing.
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Depends on Phase 0 - creates chapter infrastructure
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS all lesson writing
- **Lessons 1-10 (Phases 3-12)**: All depend on Phase 0 AND Phase 2 completion
  - Lessons can proceed in order (L1 → L2 → L3...) or in parallel by different writers
  - Recommended: Sequential for first-time implementation
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all lessons complete

### Lesson Dependencies (Content Progression)

- **Lesson 1**: Foundation (no prerequisites)
- **Lesson 2**: Requires L1 (Docker installed)
- **Lesson 3**: Requires L2 (understands containers)
- **Lesson 4**: Requires L3 (has Dockerfile to debug)
- **Lesson 5**: Requires L4 (can operate containers)
- **Lesson 6**: Requires L5 (optimized single container)
- **Lesson 7**: Requires L6 (multi-service context)
- **Lesson 8**: Requires L7 (security foundation for AI evaluation)
- **Lesson 9**: Requires L1-L8 (integrates all techniques - Layer 4 capstone)
- **Lesson 10**: Requires L1-L9 (encodes accumulated knowledge as skill - Layer 3)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Phase 2 completes, lessons CAN run in parallel (if multiple writers available)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Single Author Path (Recommended)

1. Complete Phase 0: Study & Context (1-2 hours) **← START HERE**
2. Complete Phase 1: Setup (30 min)
3. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (2 hours)
4. Complete Lessons sequentially L1→L10 (25-35 hours total)
5. Complete Phase 13: Polish (2 hours)

**Total**: ~32-42 hours

### Multi-Author Path

1. **ALL authors**: Complete Phase 0 (Study) independently - each author must understand format
2. Author A: Setup + Foundational
3. Once Foundational complete:
   - Author A: Lessons 1-4
   - Author B: Lessons 5-7
   - Author C: Lessons 8-10
4. All authors: Polish phase

**Total**: ~13-17 hours per author (including study time)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Lesson] label maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- Reference format: Gemini CLI chapter `03-built-in-tools-deep-dive.md`
- Verify constitution compliance before marking chapter complete
- Teaching modality variation enforced (10 different modalities across lessons)
- Three Roles framework INVISIBLE in L8 (validate with grep)
- L10 demonstrates Layer 3 (Intelligence Design) - creating reusable skill from accumulated knowledge

---

## Task Status

**Total Tasks**: 147
**Phases**: 14 (including Phase 0: Study)
**Lessons**: 10
**Estimated Implementation Time**: 35-45 hours (single author, including domain study)

### Layer Progression

| Layer | Lessons | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| L1 (Manual Foundation) | 1-7 | Build mental models, hands-on practice |
| L2 (AI Collaboration) | 8 | Gordon workflows, Three Roles INVISIBLE |
| L4 (Spec-Driven) | 9 | Capstone: specification-first project |
| L3 (Intelligence Design) | 10 | Encode knowledge as reusable skill |

**Note**: L3 (Intelligence Design) comes AFTER L4 (Capstone) because students need the complete end-to-end experience before they can identify patterns worth encoding as reusable intelligence.
