## Three Roles Validation (Test-003 Compliance)

### Lesson 4: Complete Three Roles Demonstration

**Role 1: AI as Teacher** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 2: The Three Roles of Checkpoint Creation" → "Role 1: AI as Teacher" (lines 332-355)
- **Evidence**: Claude explains checkpoint structure (three sections: decisions, progress, next steps), token budget discipline (500 tokens), and WHY each section matters (high-signal vs noise)
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 355: "This is **AI as Teacher**. You didn't know this pattern. AI suggested it with reasoning. You learned something."
- **Learning Content**: Student learns checkpoint pattern, token efficiency principles, structured summary methodology

**Role 2: AI as Student** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 2" → "Role 2: AI as Student" (lines 357-421)
- **Evidence**: Claude creates generic checkpoint. Student corrects with project specifics:
  - "JWT stateless auth with refresh token rotation—that's crucial"
  - "Stripe webhook verification and async charge processing specifically"
  - Checkpoint needs specific architectural decisions and concrete next steps
- **Adaptation**: Claude revises checkpoint to capture specific rationale and constraints
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 421: "This is **AI as Student**. You taught Claude what 'specific enough' means in YOUR project context. Claude learned and adapted."
- **Learning Content**: Student teaches AI domain understanding; AI learns and improves

**Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 2" → "Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence (Iteration Toward Optimal Checkpoint)" (lines 423-521)
- **Evidence**: 4 iteration rounds documented with explicit progression:
  - Iteration 1 (v1): Student expresses token budget concern (650 tokens too long)
  - Iteration 2 (v2): Claude proposes compression (trim non-essentials)
  - Iteration 3 (v3): Together test what can be dropped while preserving signal
  - Iteration 4 (Final): Convergence on 480-token checkpoint balancing completeness and efficiency
- **Convergence**: Final checkpoint NEITHER had initially—emerged from dialogue
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 500: "What happened: You had concerns about token budget. Claude suggested compression. You discussed what could be trimmed vs preserved. Together, you iterated toward a checkpoint..."
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 513: "This is **Co-Worker at work**. You raised a constraint. Claude offered approaches. You refined together."
- **Learning Content**: Neither alone solved optimal checkpoint; iteration yielded better solution

### Lesson 5: Complete Three Roles Demonstration

**Role 1: AI as Teacher** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 2: The Three Roles of Isolation Decision-Making" → "Role 1: AI as Teacher" (lines 404-430)
- **Evidence**: Claude explains isolation pattern:
  - When isolation necessary (different domains, different patterns, pollution risk)
  - How to execute isolation (checkpoint, new session, merge later)
  - Why it matters (prevents pattern pollution)
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 430: "This is **AI as Teacher**. You didn't know this framework independently."
- **Learning Content**: Student learns isolation decision framework, execution pattern, rationale

**Role 2: AI as Student** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 2" → "Role 2: AI as Student" (lines 432-482)
- **Evidence**: Claude recommends generic isolation (separate sessions). Student corrects:
  - "Both auth and payment live in User API module"
  - "Share same User model, same database session, same middleware"
  - "They're not completely separate domains"
  - "Does isolation still make sense?"
- **Adaptation**: Claude acknowledges tight coupling, revises recommendation considering higher coupling, asks clarifying questions about implications
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 482: "This is **AI as Student**. You taught Claude how YOUR project is structured. Claude learned and adapted."
- **Learning Content**: Student teaches Claude architecture; Claude learns and refines recommendation

**Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 2" → "Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence (Iteration Toward Right Decision)" (lines 484-590)
- **Evidence**: 5+ iteration rounds documented:
  - Iteration 1: Student raises concern (stateless JWT vs stateful payment patterns conflict)
  - Iteration 2: Claude proposes compression
  - Iteration 3: Student identifies problem (pattern mixing risk with both loaded)
  - Iteration 4: Claude proposes hybrid approach (compression with explicit context switching)
  - Iteration 5: Together formalize decision ("Remember, auth is stateless..." context switching)
  - Iteration 6: Together define hybrid isolation pattern
- **Convergence**: Hybrid approach (compression with explicit context boundaries) — neither had this initially
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 551: "This approach emerged from understanding YOUR architecture. Neither of us would have invented it separately."
- **Explicit Callout**: Line 569: "This is **Co-Worker at its best**. You understood architecture. Claude understood isolation patterns. Together you created something better than either alone."
- **Learning Content**: Hybrid pattern emerged from dialogue; neither alone solved it; dialogue value evident

### Test-003 Overall Compliance

**Experiment Phase** ✅

- **Section**: "Exercise 1: Experience Degradation and Recovery"
- **Activity**: Students work through 2-hour session scenario at 85% utilization
- **Evidence**: "Simulation: Session at 85% Utilization (Degraded)" shows Claude forgetting decisions, repeating suggestions
- **Student Action**: Creates checkpoint manually in response to degradation

**Observe Phase** ✅

- **Activity**: Students create checkpoint and measure recovery
- **Evidence**: "Creating Your Checkpoint" shows token count reduction (170K → 40K context)
- **Measurement**: Context reclamation calculated (65% freed), token budget validated (450 tokens)
- **Student Recognition**: Sees clear cause-effect (checkpoint size → context recovery)

**Learn Phase** ✅

- **Evidence**: Clear before/after comparison showing pollution vs clarity
- **Measurement**: Student observes "That's completely wrong" vs "Perfect. This is exactly the right pattern"
- **Student Recognition**: Sees clear cause-effect (context mixing → pollution vs isolation → clarity)

**Learn Phase** ✅

- **Activity**: Students formalize decision framework
- **Evidence**: "The Isolation Decision Framework" section presents decision flowchart and criteria table
- **Frameworks**: Task similarity scoring (0-10), pollution risk assessment (High/Medium/Low)

- ✅ Three Roles evident: AI teaches pattern, student refines with project context, convergence through iteration
- ✅ Not Stage 1 (not manual-only), Not Stage 3 (not creating reusable skill), Not Stage 4 (not spec-first)

**Status**: ✅ **CORRECTLY STAGED AS STAGE 2**

### Lesson 5: Stage 2 - AI Collaboration with Three Roles

**Stage Definition**: Concept understood manually (degradation, compression), ready for AI partnership with complex decisions (when to isolate vs compress)

**Checks**:

- ✅ Prerequisite met: Students understand compression from Lesson 4
- ✅ AI partnership needed: Isolation decision requires dialogue about domain boundaries and pollution risk

## Constitutional Compliance (CLAUDE.md Principles)

### Principle 1: Specification Primacy ✅

- **Lesson 4**: Problem (degradation at 85%) → Intent (checkpoint compression) → Solution (checkpoint template)
- **Lesson 5**: Problem (mixed tasks) → Intent (isolation decision) → Solution (decision framework)
- **Evidence**: Both lessons show intent BEFORE implementation detail

### Principle 2: Progressive Complexity ✅

- **Lesson 4**: 8 concepts (within 10-concept B1 limit), moderate scaffolding (template provided with guidance)
- **Lesson 5**: 8 concepts (within 10-concept B1 limit), moderate scaffolding (decision framework with decision table)
- **Evidence**: Related concepts chunked (checkpoint structure together, compression metrics together)

### Principle 3: Factual Accuracy ✅

- **Lesson 4**: Token budgets realistic (500 tokens for checkpoint in 200K window = 0.25% overhead)
- **Lesson 5**: Task similarity concept grounded in software architecture (domain coupling, pattern conflict)
- **Evidence**: No unverified claims, all examples grounded in real development patterns

### Principle 4: Coherent Structure ✅

- **Lesson 4** builds on: Lessons 1-2 (degradation recognition), Lesson 3 (loading strategy)
- **Lesson 5** builds on: Lessons 1-3 (degradation, loading, compression understanding)
- **Evidence**: Clear prerequisite chain; each lesson assumes prior knowledge appropriately

### Principle 5: Intelligence Accumulation ✅

- **Lesson 4**: Uses checkpoint pattern (new intelligence), references compression metrics (builds on context utilization concepts)
- **Lesson 5**: Uses task similarity scoring (new), references domain boundary concept (architectural principle)
- **Evidence**: New concepts introduced incrementally, builds on prior understanding

### Principle 6: Anti-Convergence ✅

- **Chapter 10** (Prompt Engineering): Direct teaching modality (explain → demonstrate → practice)
- **Lessons 4-5**: Hands-on discovery modality (experiment → observe → learn)
- **Evidence**: Different teaching approach from prior chapter, varied from predicted tutorial patterns

### Principle 7: Minimal Content ✅

- **Lesson 4**: All sections serve learning objectives (problem, concept, exercise, formalization, practice)
- **Lesson 5**: All sections serve learning objectives (problem, concept framework, exercise, decision table, practice)
- **Evidence**: No "nice to know" tangents, no unnecessary sections

**Result**: ✅ **ALL 7 PRINCIPLES FULLY SATISFIED**
