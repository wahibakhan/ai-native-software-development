## Three Roles Validation

### Lesson 4: Three Roles Demonstration

**Role 1: AI as Teacher** ✅

- **Location**: Section "Exercise 2: The Three Roles of Checkpoint Creation" → "Role 1: AI as Teacher"
- **Evidence**: AI explains checkpoint pattern (three sections: decisions, progress, next steps), token budget discipline, and WHY each section matters
- **Explicit Callout**: "This is **AI as Teacher**. You didn't know this pattern. AI suggested it with reasoning."
- **Learning Outcome**: Student learns checkpoint structure and reasoning

**Role 2: AI as Student** ✅

- **Location**: Section "Exercise 2" → "Role 2: AI as Student"
- **Evidence**: Claude creates generic checkpoint. Student corrects with project specifics: "JWT stateless auth with refresh token rotation," "Stripe webhook verification," decision rationale, specific constraints
- **Adaptation**: AI revises to capture specific decision rationale and constraints
- **Explicit Callout**: "This is **AI as Student**. You taught Claude what 'specific enough' means in YOUR project context. Claude learned and adapted."
- **Learning Outcome**: Student teaches AI domain knowledge; AI learns and improves

**Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence** ✅

- **Location**: Section "Exercise 2" → "Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence (Iteration Toward Optimal Checkpoint)"
- **Evidence**: 4 iteration cycles documented (Checkpoint v1 → v2 → v3 → Final)
  - Iteration 1: Student expresses token budget concern
  - Iteration 2: Claude proposes compression approach
  - Iteration 3: Together trim non-essentials while preserving signal
  - Iteration 4: AI asks clarifying questions about code state
- **Convergence**: Final checkpoint (480 tokens) balances completeness and efficiency
- **Explicit Callout**: "What happened: You had concerns about token budget. Claude suggested compression. You discussed what could be trimmed vs preserved. Together, you iterated toward a checkpoint..."
- **Explicit Callout**: "This is **Co-Worker at work**. You raised a constraint. Claude offered approaches. You refined together."
- **Learning Outcome**: Neither had optimal solution initially; emerged from iteration

### Lesson 5: Three Roles Demonstration

**Role 1: AI as Teacher** ✅

- **Location**: Section "Exercise 2: The Three Roles of Isolation Decision-Making" → "Role 1: AI as Teacher"
- **Evidence**: AI explains isolation pattern (when necessary, how to execute, why it matters), decision criteria (different domains, different patterns, pollution risk)
- **Explicit Callout**: "This is **AI as Teacher**. You didn't know this framework independently."
- **Learning Outcome**: Student learns isolation decision framework and execution pattern

**Role 2: AI as Student** ✅

- **Location**: Section "Exercise 2" → "Role 2: AI as Student"
- **Evidence**: Claude recommends generic isolation. Student corrects: "Auth and payment both in User API module, share User model, same database session"
- **Adaptation**: Claude revises recommendation considering tight coupling, acknowledges student's architecture knowledge
- **Explicit Callout**: "This is **AI as Student**. You taught Claude how YOUR project is structured. Claude learned and adapted."
- **Learning Outcome**: Student teaches Claude project architecture; AI learns and adapts

**Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence** ✅

- **Location**: Section "Exercise 2" → "Role 3: Co-Worker Convergence (Iteration Toward Right Decision)"
- **Evidence**: 3+ iteration cycles
  - Iteration 1: Student raises concern (conflicting constraints: stateless vs stateful)
  - Iteration 2: Claude proposes compression
  - Iteration 3: Student identifies problem (pattern mixing risk)
  - Iteration 4: Claude proposes hybrid approach (compression with explicit context switching)
  - Iteration 5: Together formalize the pattern
- **Convergence**: Hybrid isolation pattern (compression with explicit context boundaries) - neither had this initially
- **Explicit Callout**: "This approach emerged from understanding YOUR architecture. Neither of us would have invented it separately."
- **Explicit Callout**: "This is **Co-Worker at its best**. You understood architecture. Claude understood isolation patterns. Together you created something better than either alone."
- **Learning Outcome**: Hybrid approach emerged from dialogue, combining student's architecture knowledge and AI's isolation patterns

## Discovery Sequence Validation

### Lesson 4: Experiment → Observe → Learn

✅ **Experiment**: "Exercise 1: Experience Degradation and Recovery"

- Students work through scenario showing 85% context utilization
- Experience Claude forgetting earlier decisions (degradation)

✅ **Observe**:

- Students create checkpoint and observe context reclamation
- See token budget reduction (170K → 40K utilization)
- Measure 65% context recovery

✅ **Learn**:

- Students formalize pattern into template and metrics
- Understand checkpoint structure emerges from practice

### Lesson 5: Experiment → Observe → Learn

✅ **Experiment**: "Exercise 1: Discover Pollution Through Practice" (2 scenarios)

- Scenario 1: Payment + Authentication (high pollution - JWT vs HMAC confusion)
- Scenario 2: Two endpoints, same module (low pollution - patterns align)
- Students experience pollution and contrast with isolation

✅ **Observe**:

- With pollution: Claude suggests wrong patterns (JWT for webhook verification)
- With isolation: Claude stays focused, suggests correct pattern (HMAC)
- Clear cause-effect visible

✅ **Learn**:

- Students formalize decision framework (similarity scoring, pollution risk assessment)
- Pattern emerges from practice, not from explanation

## User Story 3 Completion Check

**User Story 3 Acceptance Criteria**:

> "As a developer managing long AI sessions or complex multi-task projects, I want to apply context compression (summarization, checkpoints) and context isolation (separate sessions), so I can reclaim context window space and prevent task interference."

**Independent Test Requirement**:

> "During a long coding session (90+ minutes, 85%+ context utilization), student can independently decide: compress via checkpoint summary + session restart, OR isolate by spawning separate session for new task. Student demonstrates decision framework: compress when continuing same task, isolate when switching contexts."

### Lesson 4 Addresses

- ✅ Context compression technique (checkpoint creation)
- ✅ Checkpoint summary structure (decisions + progress + next steps)
- ✅ Session restart pattern (reload checkpoint, continue work)
- ✅ Context reclamation metric (50%+ recovery target)
- ✅ When to compress (continuing same task, long degraded sessions)

### Lesson 5 Addresses

- ✅ Context isolation technique (separate sessions for unrelated tasks)
- ✅ Task similarity scoring (0-10 decision framework)
- ✅ Pollution risk assessment (domain boundaries, pattern conflicts)
- ✅ Decision framework (compress vs isolate based on task relatedness)
- ✅ When to isolate (unrelated tasks, pollution risk, domain boundaries)

### Independent Test Preparation

Students completing both lessons can:

- ✅ Recognize 85% context degradation (Lesson 1-2 knowledge)
- ✅ Create checkpoint summary (Lesson 4 pattern + template)
