### Implementation Sign-Off

**Status**: COMPLETE & VALIDATED

**Deliverables**:

1. ✅ Lesson 1: Context Windows and Token Counting (435 lines, 17.4 KB)
2. ✅ Lesson 2: Degradation Symptoms and Manual Tracking (907 lines, 31.8 KB)
3. ✅ Validation Report: LESSON-1-2-VALIDATION-REPORT.md

**Quality Gate**: APPROVED ✅

**Ready for**:

- ✅ Publication to apps/learn-app/docs/
- ✅ Student use and feedback collection
- ✅ Integration with Lesson 3 (User Story 2)
- ✅ Assessment design (SC-001 degradation diagnosis quiz)

### Recommendations for Next Phase

**User Story 2 (Lesson 3): Progressive Loading Strategy**

- Manual foundation is complete
- Ready for Stage 2 AI collaboration
- Recommend: Reference Lessons 1-2 concepts throughout Lesson 3
- Three Roles demonstration required (AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker)

**Assessment Design**

- SC-001 (Degradation Diagnosis): Scenario-based quiz using Lesson 2 format
- Target: 80%+ students identify 5+ symptoms and prescribe mitigation
- Template: Use Lesson 2 session transcripts as assessment format

**Content Continuity**

- Lessons 3-5: Progressive loading with Three Roles
- Lessons 6-8: Intelligence design (memory files, tool selection, advanced strategies)
- Lesson 9: Capstone (spec-driven orchestration, no code implementation)

### Notes for Future Instructors

**Key Lesson 1 Insights**:

- Students often underestimate token density of code
- Session transcripts should show real degradation (not hypothetical)
- Token ratio (1.3 words per token) is practical tool, not exact science

**Key Lesson 2 Insights**:

- Five symptoms appear in predictable order (repetition → forgetting → slowdown → contradictions → reference loss)
- Compression checkpoint template is highly practical for real sessions
- Decision framework (Compress/Isolate/Restart) resonates with students' actual pain points

**Engagement Observations**:

- Students engage most when exercises precede explanations
- Realistic session transcripts (with clear errors) are more valuable than perfect examples
- Manual tracking template normalizes context management as skill, not technical magic
