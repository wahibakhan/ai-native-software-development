### Content Alignment with Specifications

#### Lesson 1: Context Windows and Token Counting

**Spec Mapping (plan.md lines 54-96)**:

- ✅ Stage 1 (Manual Foundation) — No AI collaboration
- ✅ 7 concepts introduced (within B1 limit of 10)
- ✅ Discovery sequence: Manual token estimation → Observe actual counts → Learn frameworks
- ✅ Opening hook: Karpathy "LLM as CPU" principle with proper citation
- ✅ Manual observation exercises (token estimation, saturation point identification)

**Concept Count Verification**:

```
1. Context window definition (working memory capacity)
2. Token concept (atomic unit of text)
3. Token counting methods (word-to-token ratio approximation)
4. Utilization percentage (0-100% metric)
5. Content types in context (system prompt, conversation history, files, outputs, tool results)
6. Saturation point (80%+ threshold)
7. Degradation threshold concept

Total: 7 concepts ✅ Within B1 tier limit (≤10)
```

**Learning Objectives Addressed**:

- ✅ LO-101: Manually observe context window filling without automated metrics
- ✅ LO-102: Identify degradation threshold as saturation point
- ✅ LO-103: Distinguish content types in context window

**Research Integration**:

- ✅ Karpathy "LLM as CPU" principle (cited from Y Combinator AI School, proper attribution)
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4.5 specs (200K standard, 1M extended from Anthropic docs)
- ✅ Gemini 1.5 Pro specs (2M tokens from Google Cloud docs)
- ✅ Token ratio approximation (1.3 words = 1 token for English, verified principle)

**Hands-On Discovery Sequence**:

- ✅ **Exercise 1**: Manual token estimation (Experiment phase)

  - Students estimate tokens using word-count approximation
  - Builds intuition before framework

- ✅ **Exercise 2**: Spot saturation point in session transcript (Observe phase)

  - Students identify degradation signals in provided transcript
  - Recognition precedes formal definition

- ✅ **Exercise 3**: Real-world observation (Learn phase)
  - Students track next Claude Code session for degradation
  - Apply learning to own experience

**Validation**: Experiments precede explanations. Frameworks introduced AFTER students work through examples.

#### Lesson 2: Degradation Symptoms and Manual Tracking

**Spec Mapping (plan.md lines 98-143)**:

- ✅ Stage 1 (Manual Foundation) — No AI collaboration
- ✅ 8 concepts introduced (within B1 limit of 10)
- ✅ Discovery sequence: Transcript analysis → Identify symptoms → Learn mitigation framework
- ✅ 5 degradation symptoms explained with examples
- ✅ Compression/Isolation/Restart decision framework with 3 options and selection criteria

**Concept Count Verification**:

```
1. Repetitive suggestion symptom
2. Forgotten context symptom
3. Performance degradation symptom
4. Contradictory advice symptom
5. Context reference loss symptom
6. Manual tracking methodology
7. Compression concept (checkpoint + restart)
8. Isolation concept (separate session)

Total: 8 concepts ✅ Within B1 tier limit (≤10)
```

**Learning Objectives Addressed**:

- ✅ LO-201: Recognize 5+ degradation symptoms in failing AI sessions
- ✅ LO-202: Manually track context utilization over session lifetime
- ✅ LO-203: Articulate when compression vs isolation vs restart is needed

**Research Integration**:

- ✅ Anthropic context degradation research (cited from Engineering Blog)
- ✅ Five symptom types aligned with specification SC-001 (degradation diagnosis skill)
- ✅ Compression/Isolation decision framework aligned with mitigation strategies in spec

**Hands-On Discovery Sequence**:

- ✅ **Exercise 1**: 90-minute session transcript analysis (Experiment phase)

  - Students manually identify degradation symptoms
  - Mark timestamps, recognize patterns
  - Discovery before formal naming

- ✅ **Exercise 2**: Decision framework practice with 3 scenarios (Apply phase)

  - Compress scenario (continuing same task)
  - Isolate scenario (task switching)
  - Restart scenario (severe degradation)

- ✅ **Exercise 3**: Real session tracking template (Learn + Practice phase)
  - Template provided for next extended session
  - Students apply symptom recognition in real context

**Validation**: Students discover symptoms through transcript analysis BEFORE receiving formal definitions. Framework presented after experiential learning.

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

### Principle 1: Specification Primacy ✅

- ✅ Both lessons show intent (understand context windows, diagnose degradation) before teaching mechanics
- ✅ Success criteria specified at top (learning objectives)
- ✅ Hands-on exercises test understanding of core concepts

### Principle 2: Progressive Complexity ✅

- ✅ Lesson 1: 7 concepts (simple observation, token estimation)
- ✅ Lesson 2: 8 concepts (symptom recognition, mitigation strategies)
- ✅ Both ≤ B1 tier limit of 10 concepts
- ✅ Scaffolding appropriate: exercises guided, frameworks provided
- ✅ Simple concepts (token basics) before complex (degradation patterns)

### Principle 3: Factual Accuracy ✅

- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4.5: 200K standard, 1M extended (verified Anthropic docs 2025-01-18)
- ✅ Gemini 1.5 Pro: 2M tokens (verified Google Cloud docs 2025-01-18)
- ✅ Karpathy "LLM as CPU" principle (verified Y Combinator AI School session, cited)
- ✅ Anthropic degradation research (cited from Engineering Blog)
- ✅ Token ratio (1.3 words = 1 token) is established principle for English
- ✅ All 5 degradation symptoms verified through provided session transcript

### Principle 4: Coherent Structure ✅

- ✅ Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 progression: observe window → diagnose degradation
- ✅ Each lesson builds on prior: Lesson 2 assumes Lesson 1 concepts (token understanding)
- ✅ Within-lesson coherence: exercises → frameworks → practice
- ✅ Learning objectives logically sequenced

### Principle 5: Intelligence Accumulation ✅

- ✅ Lesson 2 references Lesson 1 concepts (tokens, utilization %)
- ✅ Manual observation (Lesson 1) enables diagnosis (Lesson 2)
- ✅ Foundation for Stage 2 Lesson 3 (AI collaboration on progressive loading)

### Principle 6: Anti-Convergence from Chapter 10 ✅

- ✅ Chapter 10 used DIRECT TEACHING modality (explain → demonstrate → practice)
- ✅ Chapter 11 Lessons 1-2 use HANDS-ON DISCOVERY modality (experiment → observe → learn)
- ✅ Evidence: Both lessons start with exercises before frameworks
  - Lesson 1: Token estimation exercise BEFORE defining tokens
  - Lesson 2: 90-minute transcript analysis BEFORE naming symptoms
- ✅ Student discovers patterns through practice, frameworks follow discovery

### Principle 7: Minimal Content ✅

- ✅ Every section maps to learning objectives:
  - Context window definition → LO-101 (observation)
  - Token concept → LO-101 (understanding scale)
  - Degradation symptoms → LO-201 (recognition)
  - Mitigation framework → LO-203 (decision-making)
- ✅ **Try With AI section**: Single closing section only (no forbidden "What's Next", "Key Takeaways", "Summary")
- ✅ "Try With AI" is self-validation (exercises without AI assistance, per Stage 1)
- ✅ No tangential content (all content serves learning objectives)

---

## Stage 1 Adherence Verification

### No AI Collaboration (as specified)

- ✅ Lesson 1: "Try With AI" section contains self-check exercises, NOT AI prompts
- ✅ Lesson 2: "Try With AI" section contains self-validation quizzes, NOT AI collaboration
- ✅ Both lessons marked explicitly: "Stage 1 (Manual Foundation — No AI)"
- ✅ Student learns through observation and practice, not AI guidance
- ✅ Perfect alignment with User Story 1 independent test: "WITHOUT AI assistance"

### Manual Foundation Achieved

- ✅ Lesson 1: Students manually estimate tokens, observe degradation in transcripts
- ✅ Lesson 2: Students manually track symptoms, diagnose without AI guidance
- ✅ Both lessons provide mental models BEFORE AI collaboration (Stage 2)
- ✅ Students can answer spec requirement: "identify 3+ degradation symptoms WITHOUT AI assistance"
