## Integration Points

### Prerequisite Knowledge (From Earlier Lessons)

- **Lesson 1-2**: Degradation symptom recognition (used to motivate checkpoint creation)
- **Lesson 3**: Progressive loading strategy (compression builds on loading concepts)

### Enables Future Lessons

- **Lesson 6**: Memory files (persistence across sessions, builds on compression/isolation patterns)
- **Lesson 8**: Validation/debugging (applies compression/isolation patterns to scenarios)
- **Lesson 9**: Capstone (orchestrates all patterns including compression/isolation)

---

## Example Scenarios Used

### Lesson 4 Scenario

**Domain**: E-commerce payment processing
**Context**: 2-hour FastAPI development session implementing Stripe webhook integration
**Degradation**: At 85% context utilization, AI forgets JWT decision, suggests webhook retry queue that was rejected
**Solution**: Create checkpoint (decisions, progress, next steps), restart session, continue work with reclaimed context

### Lesson 5 Scenarios

1. **Pollution Risk**: Authentication feature interrupted by payment bug

   - Same User API module, but JWT vs HMAC patterns conflict
   - Stateless auth vs stateful webhook handling requirements conflict
   - Hybrid solution: compression with explicit context switching

2. **Low Pollution Risk**: Two user API endpoints (password reset + 2FA)

   - Same domain, shared User model, same JWT patterns
   - Safe to compress, patterns align

3. **Decision Table Scenarios**:
   - Auth + Payment (different domain → HYBRID)
   - Password reset + 2FA (same domain → COMPRESS)
   - Payment webhook + Email notification (different domain → COMPRESS or ISOLATE)
   - Database migration + Feature (infrastructure vs feature → ISOLATE)
   - OAuth + Payment bug (high pollution → ISOLATE)
