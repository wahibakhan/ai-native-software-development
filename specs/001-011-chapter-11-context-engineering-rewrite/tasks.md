# Tasks: Chapter 11 Context Engineering Rewrite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-011-chapter-11-context-engineering-rewrite/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (6 user stories P1-P3), plan.md (9 lessons, 927 lines), ADRs (0013-0015)

**Tests**: NO tests required - Educational content chapter, validation through pedagogical review not automated testing

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (corresponding to lessons/lesson groups) to enable independent implementation and validation of pedagogical objectives.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different lessons, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6 map to lesson groups)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Chapter directory: `apps/learn-app/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/11-context-engineering-for-ai-driven-development/`
- Lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc. (9 total)
- README: `README.md` (chapter overview, auto-generated from learning objectives)

- **Research verification** (T005-T010): All parallelizable
- **Lesson 1-2 creation** (T011-T012): File creation parallel, content writing sequential (T013-T014 must follow T011-T012)
- **Lessons 4-5 file creation** (T031-T032): Parallel within Phase 5
- **Validation tasks** (T083-T091 in Phase 10): All parallelizable after lessons complete

**Sequential dependencies**:

- Lesson 3 → Lessons 4-5 (progressive loading knowledge required for compression/isolation)
- Lessons 1-5 → Lesson 8 (validation applies all patterns)
- Lessons 1-8 → Lesson 9 (capstone orchestrates all intelligence)

### Implementation Strategy

- Enables manual diagnosis without AI (Stage 1 complete)
- Students can identify context issues and understand mitigation options
- Subsequent lessons build on this foundation incrementally

**Incremental Delivery**:

1. **Increment 1** (MVP): Lessons 1-2 (US1) - Manual foundation
2. **Increment 2**: Lesson 3 (US2) - Progressive loading with AI (first Three Roles demonstration)
3. **Increment 3**: Lessons 4-5 (US3) - Compression & isolation (complete Three Roles coverage)
4. **Increment 4**: Lessons 6-7 (US4-5) - Memory files + tool selection (intelligence design)
5. **Increment 5**: Lesson 8 (Validation) - Hands-on debugging
6. **Increment 6**: Lesson 9 (US6) - Capstone spec-driven orchestration

**Quality Gates**:

- After US1: Validate Stage 1 manual foundation complete
- After US2-3: Validate Three Roles demonstrated in 3+ lessons (Test-003)
- After US4: Validate reusable intelligence created (memory-file-architecture skill)
- After US6: Validate capstone spec-only (NO implementation code, Test-008)
- Phase 10: Validate all acceptance tests (Test-001 through Test-014)

## Policy Note for Lesson Authors

**Lesson Ending Convention**: Within this chapter, each lesson must end with a single final section titled **"Try With AI"** (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next").

**AI Tool Usage**:

- Before AI tools are taught (Part 1 chapters), use ChatGPT web interface in "Try With AI" sections
- After tool onboarding (Part 2+), instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion tool (e.g., Gemini CLI, Claude CLI)
- Optionally provide both CLI and web variants of exercises for accessibility

**Safety Integration**: Safety reminders must be integrated into "Try With AI" sections as 1-2 contextual sentences, NOT standalone "Safety Note" sections.
