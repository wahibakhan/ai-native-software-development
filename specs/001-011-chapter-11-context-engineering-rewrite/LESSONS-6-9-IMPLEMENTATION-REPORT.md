## Constitutional Compliance Validation

### Principle 1: Specification Primacy

✅ **Demonstrated in**:

- Lesson 9: Entire capstone is specification-only
- Lesson 7: Tool selection is decision framework, not implementation
- Lesson 6: Memory file architecture is template-based, not code-based
- Lesson 8: Scenarios show diagnosis and strategy, not code fixes

### Principle 2: Progressive Complexity

✅ **B1 Tier Cognitive Load Validation**:

| Lesson            | Concepts    | B1 Limit | Status                  |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| 6: Memory Files   | 9           | 10       | ✅ At boundary          |
| 7: Tool Selection | 7           | 10       | ✅ Well within          |
| 8: Debugging      | 6           | 10       | ✅ Well within (review) |
| 9: Capstone       | Integration | 10       | ✅ Synthesis, not new   |

✅ **Chunking Strategy**:

- Related concepts grouped (memory files chunk as unit, not 3 separate)
- Progressive disclosure: Simple → Complex
- Each lesson builds on previous

### Principle 3: Factual Accuracy
