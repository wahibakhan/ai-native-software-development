## Constitutional Compliance Verification

### Layer 2 Implementation: ✓ PASS

**Three Roles Framework**:

- AI as Teacher: Demonstrated through agent proposing options (Exercise 2, Part 3)
- AI as Student: Demonstrated through agent adapting to feedback (Part 3, Exercise 3)
- AI as Co-Worker: Demonstrated through convergence and iteration (Part 4, Exercise 4)

**Framework Invisibility**: ✓ COMPLETE

- ZERO explicit role labels in student-facing text
- ZERO meta-commentary exposing pedagogical design
- Students EXPERIENCE roles through examples, not told about them
- Grep validation: "What to notice", "AI as", "What you learned" = 0 matches in student sections

### Specification-First Pattern: ✓ PASS

All code discussion follows Spec→Plan→Implementation→Validation pattern:

- Part 7 Recipe Finder: Clear specification → Task List → Implementation Plan → Code → Walkthrough
- Students evaluate code against specifications (no manual code writing)
- Emphasis throughout: specifications drive better AI outcomes

### Meta-Commentary Prohibition: ✓ PASS

Banned patterns checked:

- "What to notice" in Try With AI section: NOT FOUND
- "AI is teaching you" or "AI taught you": NOT FOUND
- "What you learned/AI learned": Only in "Part 10: What You Learned" (outcomes focus, not pedagogy)
- "This is AI as Teacher": NOT FOUND
- Framework exposition: NOT FOUND (framework stays invisible)

### Content Structure: ✓ PASS

**Lesson ends correctly**:

- Part 10: "What You Learned" (outcomes only)
- Try With AI: Exploration section with prompts
- Next Lesson Preview
- Additional Resources

NO prohibited ending sections: "Key Takeaways", "Congratulations", "What's Next"

## Pedagogical Quality Verification

### Learning Objectives: ✓ ALL ACHIEVED

1. Use Agent-Assisted Development workflow → Part 2 (Exercises 1-2) + Part 7
2. Review and approve Implementation Plans → Part 3 (Exercise 3) + Part 7, Step 5
3. Work in parallel while agents research → Part 4 (Exercise 4) + Part 7, Steps 4, 6
4. Leverage browser integration for testing → Part 5 (Exercise 5) + Part 7, Step 7
5. Build complete project with artifacts → Part 7 (Recipe Finder, 10 steps)

### Complexity Alignment (B1): ✓ APPROPRIATE

**Proficiency Level**: B1 (Intermediate)
**New Concepts**: 10 (within B1 range of 7-10)
**Scaffolding**: Moderate (heavy examples, guided exercises, synthesis project)
**Bloom's Level**: Apply/Analyze (B1 range)

### Exercises: ✓ 6 GRADED EXERCISES

1. Exercise 1: Ask Always mode (README.md)
2. Exercise 2: Ask Sometimes mode (error handling)
3. Exercise 3: Plan review (API integration)
4. Exercise 4: Parallel workflow (UI + research)
5. Exercise 5: Browser testing (login form, 8 test cases)
6. Exercise 6: Walkthrough review (dark mode toggle)

Each exercise includes learning outcome and reflection prompt.

### Production Examples: ✓ ALL RELEVANT

- Login form with validation (authentication patterns)
- Weather widget (API integration, caching)
- Recipe finder (full-stack project)
- Error handling patterns (network errors, rate limiting)
- Authentication (bcrypt, JWT, sessions)

NO toy apps found (no "counter" or "todo" examples as primary teaching tool).

## Success Metrics

Students completing this lesson can:

1. **Configure autonomy modes** — Choose Ask Always, Ask Sometimes, or Full Auto based on task complexity and risk
2. **Review implementation plans** — Identify potential issues in architecture before coding
3. **Decompose parallel tasks** — Structure projects so agents and humans work simultaneously
4. **Interpret test results** — Evaluate browser testing output and approve/request changes
5. **Navigate artifact workflow** — Move from specification through Task List → Plan → Implementation → Walkthrough
6. **Select appropriate IDE** — Choose Zed, Cursor, or Antigravity based on project needs
7. **Build projects with AI** — Complete features using pure artifact-driven methodology
