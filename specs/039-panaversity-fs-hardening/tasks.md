# Tasks: PanaversityFS Production Hardening

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/039-panaversity-fs-hardening/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete)
**Generated**: 2025-12-04

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6)
- All file paths relative to `panaversity-fs/` project root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Add dependencies and create project scaffolding

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Book Schema Validation on Write (Priority: P2)

---

## Phase 9: Idempotent Delete (Cross-Cutting)

**Purpose**: Ensure delete operations are idempotent per spec assumption

- [X] T061 Refactor `src/panaversity_fs/tools/content.py` `delete_content()` to return success even if file doesn't exist (idempotent). *(Already implemented with `existed: false` response)*
- [X] T062 [P] Create idempotent delete tests in `tests/unit/test_content_tools.py` (`test_delete_nonexistent_content_idempotent`, `test_delete_twice_idempotent`) and `tests/unit/test_overlay_content.py` (`test_delete_overlay_idempotent`).

---

## Phase 10: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final validation of tests created in earlier phases. **No new test code here**—this phase runs the existing test suites to verify full-system integration.

- [X] T063 Run all integration tests on SQLite backend: `pytest tests/integration/` - all 24 tests pass.
- [X] T064 Run all property-based tests with `pytest tests/property/ -v` - all 20 tests pass.
- [X] T065 Run performance benchmarks with `pytest tests/performance/ -v` - all 5 tests pass.
- [X] T066 [P] Update `docs/MCP-TOOLS.md` with new features (validate_book, delta_build, overlay support FR-016/017/018).
- [X] T067 [P] **CI sanity check only** (not for production): Verify migration cycle with `alembic downgrade base && alembic upgrade head`. Production uses fresh-start deployment per plan—never run downgrade in prod.
- [X] T068 Final acceptance test: Full test suite passes (279 tests) including all user story scenarios.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 are P1 priority - complete first
  - US3, US4, US5 are P2 priority - can proceed after P1 stories
  - US6 is P3 priority - complete last
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (uses journal for prev_hash lookup)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Independent
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Uses path_utils from Phase 2
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (uses journal for manifest computation)

### Parallel Opportunities

Within Phase 2 (Foundational):
- T011-T015 (path validation) can run in parallel with T005-T010 (database)
- T016-T018 (metrics) can run in parallel with both

Within each User Story:
- All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel after implementation tasks

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 Foundations

```bash
# Launch in parallel - different files, no dependencies:
Task T005: Create database/models.py
Task T011: Create path_utils.py
Task T016: Create metrics.py

# Then launch tests in parallel:
Task T010: Create tests/unit/test_journal.py
Task T015: Create tests/unit/test_path_utils.py
Task T018: Create tests/unit/test_metrics.py
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Archive downloads)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Conflict detection)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 independently
6. Deploy/demo - CI/CD pipeline and agent writes now reliable

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 + US2 → Test → Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add US3 (Audit) → Test → Deploy
4. Add US4 (Overlays) → Test → Deploy
5. Add US5 (Schema) → Test → Deploy
6. Add US6 (Delta) → Test → Deploy
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1) + Phase 4 (US2)**

This delivers:
- Reliable archive downloads (fixes 502 timeouts)
- Conflict detection (fixes uncertain updates)
- Foundation for all future stories

Estimated: ~10 tasks for MVP core functionality

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All file paths relative to `panaversity-fs/` project root
