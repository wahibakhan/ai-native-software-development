# Tasks: Chapter 14 - Data Types (Beginner-Friendly Redesign)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/013-chapter-14-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅ completed), spec.md (✅ approved)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by lesson to enable independent implementation and validation of each lesson. Each lesson can be created, reviewed, and validated before moving to the next.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (e.g., L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, README)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Content files**: `apps/learn-app/docs/04-Python-Fundamentals/14-data-types/`
- **Lesson format**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Structure**: Educational content, not software (no src/tests directories)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
2. **Phase 2 (Lesson 1)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - foundational concepts
3. **Phase 3 (Lesson 2)**: Depends on Lesson 1 validation (builds on type() concept)
4. **Phase 4 (Lesson 3)**: Depends on Lesson 2 validation (independent but sequential)
5. **Phase 5 (Lesson 4)**: Depends on Lesson 3 validation (references previous lessons)
6. **Phase 6 (Lesson 5)**: Depends on Lessons 1-4 validation (integrates all concepts)
7. **Phase 7 (Final)**: Depends on all lessons complete

### Lesson Creation Pattern (Repeat for each lesson)

1. Create YAML frontmatter
2. Write content sections in order (Hook → Concepts → Code → Exercises → AI → Summary)
3. Validate content structure
4. Validate writing quality
5. Mark lesson complete
6. Proceed to next lesson

### Parallel Opportunities

Within each lesson, these can be done in parallel if multiple writers:

- Hook and Summary (independent of middle content)
- Exercises and "Try With AI" sections (both depend on main content being complete)

However, for educational content, **sequential execution is recommended** to maintain narrative coherence.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Sequential Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Setup (30 min)
2. **Phase 2**: Lesson 1 + validation (3-4 hours)
   - **STOP**: Validate Lesson 1 independently
3. **Phase 3**: Lesson 2 + validation (3-4 hours)
   - **STOP**: Validate Lesson 2 and check L1→L2 transition
4. **Phase 4**: Lesson 3 + validation (3-4 hours)
   - **STOP**: Validate Lesson 3 and check L2→L3 transition
5. **Phase 5**: Lesson 4 + validation (4-5 hours)
   - **STOP**: Validate Lesson 4 and check L3→L4 transition
6. **Phase 6**: Lesson 5 + validation (4-5 hours)
   - **STOP**: Validate Lesson 5 and check L4→L5 transition
7. **Phase 7**: Final chapter validation (2-3 hours)
8. **Total**: 20-24 hours

### Quality Gates (CRITICAL)

After EACH lesson:

- ✅ Concept-before-syntax pattern followed
- ✅ WHAT→WHY→WHEN→Code maintained
- ✅ Type hints in ALL examples
- ✅ Real-world examples (not x/y/z)
- ✅ "Try With AI" section included
- ✅ Success criteria addressed
- ✅ Cognitive load within limits
- ✅ Writing is engaging and coherent

Do NOT proceed to next lesson until current lesson passes all quality gates.

---

## Notes

- Educational content requires sequential creation for narrative coherence
- Each lesson should be validated before proceeding (validation gates are critical)
- README.md provides chapter overview and navigation
- YAML frontmatter provides rich metadata for learning management systems
- "Try With AI" sections enable co-learning partnership (Constitution Principle 18)
- Concept-before-syntax pattern is non-negotiable (core pedagogical requirement)
