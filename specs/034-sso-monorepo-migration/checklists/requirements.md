# Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature**: SSO Monorepo Migration
**Spec File**: specs/034-sso-monorepo-migration/spec.md
**Validated**: 2025-12-16
**Agent**: spec-architect v3.0

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec appropriately focuses on outcomes rather than git command specifics. User scenarios are clear and testable.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3 prioritized)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (constraints + non-goals)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 10 functional requirements are specific and measurable. Edge cases section addresses key failure modes. Success criteria have concrete verification commands.

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Evals-first pattern followed (evals before spec)

**Notes**: Four user stories cover developer workflow (local dev), CI integration, git history, and human review tasks. Priority rankings (P1/P2/P3) are justified.

---

## Formal Verification

- [x] Invariants identified and documented
- [x] Small scope test passed (3-5 instances)
- [x] No counterexamples found (or all addressed)
- [x] Relational constraints verified (cycles, coverage, uniqueness)

**Notes**: Complexity assessment: MEDIUM (5 entities: SSO app, Nx config, git history, dependencies, conflicting files). Formal verification applied with no counterexamples found.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Readiness Score**: 9/10

All checklist items pass. Spec is complete, unambiguous, and testable. Success criteria are measurable with concrete verification commands. Edge cases and non-goals clearly defined.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to planning phase (`/sp.plan 034-sso-monorepo-migration`)
