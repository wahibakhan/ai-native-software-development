### Lesson 21: Capstone - Event-Driven Agent Notifications

**File**: `21-capstone-event-driven-notifications.md`
**Layer**: L4 (Spec-Driven Capstone)
**Proficiency**: B1
**Bloom's Level**: Create
**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Key Concepts from Expertise Skill**:
- Full event-driven architecture implementation
- Task API event integration
- Notification service consumer
- Audit log consumer
- Schema Registry integration
- End-to-end testing

**Learning Objectives**:
1. **Write** a specification for event-driven notifications that includes intent, constraints, and success criteria (B1, Create)
2. **Implement** the specification by composing skills from previous lessons (producers, consumers, schemas) (B1, Create)
3. **Validate** the implementation against the specification with end-to-end tests (B1, Evaluate)

**Content Outline**:
- Phase 1: Write Specification (25 min)
  - Intent: Add event-driven notifications to Task API
  - Constraints: Use Avro schemas, at-least-once delivery, audit trail
  - Success criteria: Events published on task creation, notification service receives, audit logged
- Phase 2: Compose Skills (45 min)
  - Skill 1: Producer integration from Lesson 9
  - Skill 2: Schema design from Lesson 10
  - Skill 3: Consumer implementation from Lesson 16
  - AI orchestrates implementation from spec
- Phase 3: Validate (20 min)
  - Test: Create task, verify event published
  - Test: Verify notification consumer receives
  - Test: Verify audit log entry created

### Lesson 22: Building the Kafka Event Schema Skill

**File**: `22-kafka-event-schema-skill.md`
**Layer**: L3 (Intelligence Design - Skill Creation)
**Proficiency**: B1
**Bloom's Level**: Create
**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Key Concepts from Expertise Skill**:
- Reusable skill design
- Persona + Questions + Principles pattern
- Event schema design patterns
- Topic naming conventions
- Schema evolution strategies

**Learning Objectives**:
1. **Extract** reusable event schema design patterns from chapter learnings into a skill specification (B1, Create)
2. **Design** a skill with clear persona, triggering questions, and decision principles (B1, Create)
3. **Test** the skill on a novel domain (non-Task API) to verify reusability (B1, Evaluate)

**Content Outline**:
- What is a skill? Reusable intelligence for future projects
- Skill structure: Persona, When to Use, Principles, Decision Logic
- Extracting patterns from Chapter 52:
  - Event naming: domain.action
  - Schema fields: event_id, event_type, occurred_at, data, metadata
  - Evolution strategy: backward compatible only
  - Topic design: single vs per-event-type
- Writing the skill YAML frontmatter
- Testing on new domain: e-commerce order events
- Integrating skill into Claude Code

## Implementation Checklist

For each lesson, implementer must:

- [ ] Include full YAML frontmatter (sidebar_position, title, description, keywords, skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation)
- [ ] Write compelling narrative opening (2-3 paragraphs before first section)
- [ ] Include key concepts from expertise skill
- [ ] Create 3 "Try With AI" prompts with learning explanations
- [ ] Add code examples with type hints (confluent-kafka patterns)
- [ ] Include comparison tables where appropriate
- [ ] Link to Task API from Part 6 where relevant
- [ ] Verify all Strimzi/Kafka commands work on Docker Desktop K8s
- [ ] Test code examples before inclusion
