## Lesson 9: Capstone — Spec-Driven Orchestration

### Status: ✅ PASS (Already Compliant)

### Verification Checklist

#### SC-006: Capstone is Specification-Only ✅ PASS

**Test**: Lesson 9 requires writing specification, zero implementation code

**Capstone Exercise** (from Lesson 9):

```markdown
## Capstone Project: Write Your Specification

### Your Task

Write a complete specification for the context-aware development tool.

**Constraints**:

1. Specification-Only: ZERO implementation code
2. Intent Before Implementation: Focus on WHAT, not HOW
3. Completeness: Answer all critical questions
4. Length: 3-5 pages
```

**Validation**: Capstone is specification-only. Students write specs, NOT code.

---

#### Algorithms in Plain English (Not Code) ✅ PASS

**Example from Lesson 9**:

```markdown
## Compression/Isolation Decision Logic

Compression Triggers:
IF utilization > 80%
AND session_duration > 60 minutes
AND task_status IN ('in_progress', 'near_completion')
THEN create checkpoint and restart session

Isolation Triggers:
IF similarity_score <50%
AND new_task_complexity > current_context_complexity
THEN recommend isolated session
```

**Validation**: Algorithms use plain English IF/THEN statements. NOT pseudo-code or runnable code.

---

#### Orchestration of Lessons 1-8 ✅ PASS

**Lesson 9 References**:

- **Lesson 1-2**: Context Monitor component (tracks utilization, alerts at 70%/80%/90%)
- **Lesson 3**: Progressive Loading (Foundation/Current/On-Demand phases)
- **Lesson 4**: Checkpoint Engine (creates checkpoint when 80% + 60min)
- **Lesson 5**: Task Similarity Analyzer (recommends isolation when score <50%)
- **Lesson 6**: Memory File Manager (loads/updates CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, decisions.md)
- **Lesson 7**: Tool Selector (recommends Claude Code vs Gemini CLI)
- **Lesson 8**: System handles failures gracefully (debugging considerations)

**Validation**: Lesson 9 orchestrates ALL accumulated techniques from Lessons 1-8.

## Recommendations

### For Future Lessons:

1. **Pre-Implementation Check**: Always verify Part/Chapter prerequisites BEFORE creating code examples
2. **Context-First Protocol**: Read chapter-index.md to determine proficiency level and prerequisite knowledge
3. **Code Constraint Validation**: For Part 3 chapters, grep for programming syntax BEFORE final commit
