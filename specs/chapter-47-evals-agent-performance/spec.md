# Chapter Specification: Chapter 47 - Evals: Measuring Agent Performance

**Part**: 6 (AI Native Software Development)
**Chapter**: 47
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: Draft
**Proficiency Level**: B1-B2 (Intermediate to Upper Intermediate)
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 34-36 (SDK chapters), Chapter 46 (TDD for Agents)

## Chapter Overview

This chapter teaches the **thinking and methodology** behind agent evaluations (evals)—the systematic approach to measuring AI agent reasoning quality. Unlike TDD (Chapter 46) which tests code correctness with deterministic PASS/FAIL outcomes, evals measure probabilistic reasoning quality with scores.

**Core Thesis** (Andrew Ng): *"One of the biggest predictors for whether someone is able to build agentic workflows really well is whether or not they're able to drive a really disciplined evaluation process."*

**Running Example**: Task API agent (from Ch40) evaluated for routing decisions, tool selection, and output quality

**Student Skill**: `agent-evals` (built in L00, extended throughout chapter)

**Lesson Count**: 11 lessons (L00-L10) covering eval concepts, graders, error analysis, and production workflows

**Key Distinction**:
| Aspect | TDD (Ch46) | Evals (Ch47) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Tests | Does function return correct output? | Did agent make the right decision? |
| Outcome | PASS or FAIL (deterministic) | Scores (probabilistic) |
| Example | "Does get_weather() return valid JSON?" | "Did agent correctly interpret user intent?" |
| Analogy | Testing if calculator works | Testing if student knows WHEN to use multiplication |

## Assumed Knowledge

**What students know BEFORE this chapter** (from Prerequisites):
- SDK usage: OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, Claude Agent SDK (Ch34-36)
- Agent architecture: tools, system prompts, routing, handoffs
- TDD concepts: tests, assertions, pytest, mocking (Ch46)
- Running example: Task API agent with create/update/query capabilities
- Basic Python testing patterns

**What this chapter must explain from scratch**:
- Evals as "exams for agent reasoning" (not code tests)
- The two evaluation axes: Objective/Subjective × Ground Truth availability
- Graders: automated quality checks with binary criteria (not 1-5 scales)
- Error analysis: systematic counting of failure patterns
- Component-level vs End-to-end evaluations
- LLM-as-judge pattern and its limitations (position bias)
- Regression protection: running evals on every change
- The Build-Evaluate-Analyze-Improve loop

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** evals from traditional tests (TDD) based on determinism and outcome types
2. **Design** evaluation datasets with typical, edge, and error cases (10-20 quality cases)
3. **Create** graders using binary criteria (not 1-5 scales) for reliable assessment
4. **Implement** LLM-as-judge graders with proper prompt structure

6. **Decide** when to use end-to-end vs component-level evaluations
7. **Build** regression protection by running evals on every agent change
8. **Apply** the Build-Evaluate-Analyze-Improve loop to improve agent quality
9. **Extend** their `agent-evals` skill with patterns from each lesson

## User Scenarios & Testing (Learner Journeys)

### Learner Journey 1 - Build First Eval Dataset (Priority: P1)

A student learning to create their first evaluation dataset for the Task API agent, understanding what makes a good eval case.

**Why this priority**: Dataset design is foundational. Without good test cases, all other eval work is meaningless.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a 20-case eval dataset covering typical, edge, and error scenarios for Task API agent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student with SDK knowledge, **When** they examine Task API agent outputs manually, **Then** they can identify 3-5 behaviors that need improvement.

2. **Given** identified improvement areas, **When** student creates eval cases, **Then** each case has clear input, expected behavior, and rationale for inclusion.

3. **Given** an eval dataset, **When** student runs agent against it, **Then** they can calculate a baseline pass rate (e.g., 70%).

---

### Learner Journey 2 - Create Binary-Criteria Graders (Priority: P1)

A student learning to build graders that use binary yes/no criteria instead of unreliable 1-5 scales.

**Why this priority**: Graders define "good" automatically. The binary criteria pattern is the key insight from Andrew Ng's methodology.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a grader with 5 binary criteria that produces consistent scores.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** understanding of why 1-5 scales are unreliable, **When** student converts a subjective quality rubric to binary criteria, **Then** grader produces repeatable scores.

2. **Given** a binary grader, **When** student runs it on 10 agent outputs, **Then** scores are consistent (no variance) on identical inputs.

3. **Given** Task API agent output, **When** student applies their grader, **Then** they get a 0-5 score based on criteria met.

---

### Learner Journey 3 - Perform Systematic Error Analysis (Priority: P1)

A student learning to systematically count errors by component rather than going by "gut feel."

**Why this priority**: Error analysis determines WHERE to focus improvement efforts. This is Andrew Ng's key insight about less experienced teams under-investing in analysis.

**Independent Test**: Student can create an error analysis spreadsheet that shows which component causes most failures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 20 failed eval cases, **When** student analyzes traces, **Then** they can categorize each failure by component (routing, tool selection, output format, etc.).

2. **Given** categorized errors, **When** student counts patterns, **Then** they can identify the component with highest error percentage (e.g., "45% of errors from routing").

3. **Given** error analysis results, **When** student prioritizes fixes, **Then** they focus on high-frequency × feasibility-to-fix components.

---

### Learner Journey 4 - Build Regression Protection (Priority: P2)

A student learning to run evals on every agent change to catch regressions.

**Why this priority**: Without regression protection, improvements in one area can break other areas. This is the eval-driven development loop.

**Independent Test**: Student can run eval suite before and after a change and compare results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** baseline eval results (70%), **When** student makes a change to improve routing, **Then** they can re-run evals and compare (e.g., 85%).

2. **Given** an improvement that breaks something else, **When** student compares before/after, **Then** they detect the regression before shipping.

3. **Given** consistent improvement pattern, **When** student iterates (70% → 85% → 92%), **Then** they have confidence to deploy.

---

### Learner Journey 5 - Build Agent-Evals Skill (Priority: P2)

A student building their `agent-evals` skill through the chapter.

**Why this priority**: Skill-First pattern - the chapter's meta-learning outcome. Students build a reusable asset.

**Independent Test**: Student's skill can help them design evals, create graders, and analyze errors for ANY agent (not just Task API).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student completing L00, **When** they create initial `agent-evals` skill, **Then** skill includes eval design patterns and grader templates.

2. **Given** lessons L01-L09 completed, **When** student tests their skill on a new agent, **Then** skill helps them create appropriate evals.

3. **Given** L10 completed, **When** student finalizes skill, **Then** it's production-ready with error analysis and regression patterns.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when LLM-as-judge disagrees with human judgment?
  - This indicates the grader rubric needs refinement; add more specific criteria
- How do you handle non-deterministic agent outputs?
  - Run multiple times (3-5) and look for patterns; accept variability in scores
- What if all evals pass but users still complain?
  - Eval dataset doesn't cover real usage; add cases from production failures
- How many eval cases are "enough"?
  - Start with 10-20; grow when evals fail to capture your judgment about quality

| 1-5 scale ratings | LLMs poorly calibrated | Binary criteria summed |
| Ignoring traces | Miss root cause | Read intermediate outputs |
| End-to-end only | Too noisy for debugging | Add component-level evals |
| Synthetic test data | Misses real-world messiness | Use actual user queries |
| Going by gut | May work on wrong component | Count errors systematically |
