# Implementation Plan: Chapter 47 - Evals: Measuring Agent Performance

**Based on**: spec.md and clarifications.md
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Target**: 11 lessons (L00-L10)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach
This is a **conceptual chapter** teaching evaluation THINKING, not specific tooling. The implementation focuses on:
1. Clear analogies and frameworks (exams for reasoning, four quadrants)
2. Practical exercises with Task API agent running example
3. Skill-First pattern with `agent-evals` skill development
4. Framework-agnostic patterns that apply to any SDK

### Quality Reference
All lessons will follow the format of `01-the-2025-inflection-point.md`:
- Full YAML frontmatter (skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation)
- Compelling narrative opening (2-3 paragraphs before first section)
- Tables for comparisons
- 3 "Try With AI" prompts with "What you're learning" explanations
- Safety notes where appropriate

## Implementation Notes

### Common Elements Across All Lessons

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Full structure with skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation
2. **Narrative Opening**: 2-3 paragraphs connecting to real-world relevance
3. **Tables**: Use for comparisons (TDD vs Evals, Component vs E2E)
4. **Try With AI**: 3 prompts per lesson with "What you're learning" explanations
5. **Reflect on Your Skill**: 3-5 sentences at lesson end (except L00, L10)

### Running Example: Task API Agent

All exercises use the Task API agent with these eval scenarios:
- **Routing**: create vs update vs query intent classification
- **Tool Selection**: correct tool calls for given intent
- **Output Format**: proper JSON structure in responses
- **Error Handling**: graceful handling of invalid inputs

### Framework-Agnostic Code

All code examples use generic Python patterns:
```python
# Generic pattern - works with any SDK
def evaluate_agent(agent, eval_case):
    """Run agent and evaluate response."""
    response = agent.run(eval_case["input"])
    score = grader(response, eval_case["expected"])
    return {"case": eval_case["name"], "score": score}
```

### Quality Validation

Before marking lessons complete:
1. Run educational-validator on each lesson
2. Verify factual claims with WebSearch
3. Check YAML frontmatter completeness
4. Verify 3 "Try With AI" prompts exist
5. Verify "Reflect on Your Skill" section exists

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Lessons too abstract | Include concrete Task API examples in every lesson |
| SDK-specific code creep | Use generic function signatures, add "works with any SDK" notes |
| Missing skill reflection | Template checklist before finalizing each lesson |
| Inconsistent quality | Compare each lesson to quality reference before completion |
