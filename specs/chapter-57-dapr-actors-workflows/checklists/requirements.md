# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 57 - Dapr Actors & Workflows

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Revised**: 2025-12-29 (Expanded to 18 lessons)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: Technology stack section is appropriate for educational content specifying what students will learn
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - Focused on learning outcomes and learner journeys
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - Written for educators/content creators, appropriate audience
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - All requirements are specific and complete
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - Each FR has clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - SC-001 through SC-014 all have specific metrics
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - Measured by student outcomes, not system metrics
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - Each learner journey has Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - Actor reactivation, determinism failures, reminder retries covered
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - In Scope / Out of Scope sections defined
  - Deferred: Actor Security, DACA Runtime specifics, Protobuf serialization
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - Ch53 dependency, Redis availability, Python proficiency documented

## Educational Content Quality

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section present (REQUIRED for chapters)
  - Detailed what students know vs. what must be taught
- [x] Proficiency Level specified (B1)
- [x] Layer progression defined (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4)
- [x] Skill-First pattern included (L00 extends skill, L20 finalizes)
- [x] Every lesson has "Reflect on Your Skill" requirement documented
- [x] Learning outcomes are measurable and aligned with Bloom's taxonomy

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - FR-001 through FR-075 mapped to 21 lessons
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - 4 learner journeys covering actors, workflows, patterns, skill extension
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Technology choices are appropriate for educational content

## Notes

- **REVISED v2**: Expanded from 18 to 21 lessons for comprehensive coverage (final Dapr chapter)
- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- All 75 functional requirements mapped to 21 lessons (L00-L20)
- Skill-First pattern properly integrated with L00 and L20 bookends
- Running example (TaskActor, ChatActor, TaskProcessingWorkflow) consistent throughout
- Source material coverage:
  - `05_agent_actors/` (8 sections) → L01-L08
  - `06_dapr_workflows/` (7 sections) → L09-L14
  - `08_actor_security/` (3 sections) → L18
  - Official docs: `namespaced-actors.md` → L17
  - Official docs: `workflow-multi-app.md` → L16
  - Integration + Capstone → L15, L19-L20
- **NOW INCLUDED** (previously deferred):
  - Multi-App Workflows (cross-service orchestration)
  - Namespaced Actors (multi-tenancy)
  - Actor Security (state encryption, mTLS, audit logging)
- Only deferred: Actor Partitioning (DEPRECATED in Dapr 1.15+), DACA Actor Runtime specifics
