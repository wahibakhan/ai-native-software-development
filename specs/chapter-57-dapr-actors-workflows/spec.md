# Chapter Specification: Chapter 57 - Dapr Actors & Workflows for Stateful Agents

**Part**: 7 (AI Cloud-Native Development)
**Chapter**: 59
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Status**: Draft (Revised)
**Proficiency Level**: B1 (Intermediate)
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 53 (Dapr Core - Sidecar Building Blocks)

## Chapter Overview

This chapter provides **comprehensive coverage** of Dapr Actors and Workflows for building stateful, long-running AI agent systems. Building on the Dapr Core foundation from Chapter 53, students learn the actor model for encapsulating entity state with turn-based concurrency, and workflow orchestration for durable, fault-tolerant multi-step processes.

**Running Example**: Task API extended with TaskActor (stateful task entities) and TaskProcessingWorkflow (durable task orchestration)

**Student Skill**: `dapr-deployment` (extended from Ch53 with actors & workflows)

**Lesson Count**: 21 lessons (L00-L20) covering actors, workflows, patterns, security, and production deployment

---

## Assumed Knowledge

**What students know BEFORE this chapter** (from Ch53):
- Dapr sidecar architecture and building block concept
- Service invocation with automatic discovery and mTLS
- State management with pluggable stores (Redis)
- Pub/Sub messaging with CloudEvents
- Dapr CLI and local development workflow
- Deploying Dapr on Kubernetes with Helm
- Python SDK: `dapr-client` and `dapr-ext-fastapi`
- Task API implementation with Dapr state and pub/sub

**What this chapter must explain from scratch**:
- The Actor Model (Hewitt, 1973) - conceptual foundation
- Virtual Actors pattern (Microsoft Orleans) - Dapr's implementation
- Turn-based concurrency (single-threaded per actor)
- Actor lifecycle (activation, deactivation, garbage collection)
- Timers vs Reminders (non-persistent vs persistent scheduling)
- Workflow orchestration concepts (durable execution, replay)
- Workflow determinism requirements
- Workflow patterns (chaining, fan-out/fan-in, saga, monitor)
- Python SDK: `dapr-ext-workflow`

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

1. **Explain** the Actor Model and when to use actors vs. traditional state management
2. **Implement** Dapr Actors in Python using `dapr-ext-fastapi`
3. **Manage** actor state with persistence and turn-based concurrency
4. **Configure** actor timers and reminders for scheduled work
5. **Design** durable workflows using `dapr-ext-workflow`
6. **Apply** workflow patterns (chaining, fan-out/fan-in, saga, monitor)
7. **Write** deterministic workflow code following Dapr's constraints
8. **Combine** actors and workflows for complex stateful agent systems
9. **Extend** their `dapr-deployment` skill with actors and workflows patterns

---

## User Scenarios & Testing (Learner Journeys)

### Learner Journey 1 - Build Stateful Task Actor (Priority: P1)

A student learning to encapsulate task state in an actor that manages its own lifecycle, handles concurrent updates safely, and schedules deadline reminders.

**Why this priority**: Actors are the foundation for stateful agents. Understanding turn-based concurrency and state encapsulation is essential before workflows.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a TaskActor that persists state, handles method calls, and sets up reminders - all testable locally with `dapr run`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student with Ch53 Dapr knowledge, **When** they create a TaskActor with `dapr-ext-fastapi`, **Then** they can invoke actor methods via HTTP and see state persisted in Redis.

2. **Given** a TaskActor implementation, **When** student registers a reminder for a deadline, **Then** the reminder fires even after actor deactivation/reactivation.

3. **Given** multiple concurrent requests to the same actor, **When** student observes execution, **Then** they see turn-based (sequential) processing - no race conditions.

---

### Learner Journey 2 - Orchestrate Task Processing Workflow (Priority: P1)

A student learning to orchestrate multi-step task processing using durable workflows that survive failures and restarts.

**Why this priority**: Workflows are essential for long-running agent processes (approval flows, multi-step AI pipelines). Equal priority with actors as they serve different but complementary use cases.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a TaskProcessingWorkflow that chains activities, handles failures with retries, and can be queried for status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student understanding workflow concepts, **When** they implement a chained workflow with validation → assignment → completion activities, **Then** workflow executes in order and persists progress.

2. **Given** a running workflow, **When** an activity fails mid-execution, **Then** workflow automatically retries and resumes from the last checkpoint (not from scratch).

3. **Given** a workflow waiting for external input, **When** student raises an event via CLI or API, **Then** workflow receives the event and continues execution.

---

### Learner Journey 3 - Apply Advanced Workflow Patterns (Priority: P2)

A student learning to implement production workflow patterns like fan-out/fan-in for parallel processing and saga for compensation.

**Why this priority**: Production agent systems require parallel task processing and rollback capabilities. Important but builds on P1 foundations.

**Independent Test**: Student can implement a fan-out workflow that processes multiple items in parallel and aggregates results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a list of tasks to process, **When** student implements fan-out/fan-in pattern, **Then** all tasks execute in parallel and results are aggregated.

2. **Given** a multi-step workflow with compensatable actions, **When** a later step fails, **Then** compensation activities execute in reverse order (saga pattern).

---

### Learner Journey 4 - Extend Dapr Deployment Skill (Priority: P2)

A student extending their `dapr-deployment` skill (from Ch53) with actor and workflow patterns.

**Why this priority**: Skill-First pattern - the chapter's meta-learning outcome. Students build a reusable asset.

**Independent Test**: Student's extended skill can generate TaskActor and TaskProcessingWorkflow implementations correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student's `dapr-deployment` skill from Ch53, **When** they complete L00 extending it with actor/workflow docs, **Then** the skill knows actor registration and workflow runtime patterns.

2. **Given** lessons L01-L08 completed, **When** student uses their skill to generate actor code, **Then** output includes correct decorator syntax, state manager usage, and reminder registration.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an actor is invoked during garbage collection?
  - Dapr reactivates it automatically (virtual actor pattern)
- How does workflow handle non-deterministic code (e.g., `datetime.now()`)?
  - Workflow fails on replay; must use `ctx.current_utc_datetime`
- What happens when reminder fires but actor service is down?
  - Reminder is retried (up to 3 times with backoff) then stored in Scheduler
- How does workflow survive complete cluster restart?
  - State persisted in actor backend; workflow resumes from last checkpoint
